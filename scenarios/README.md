# `scenarios/` — scenario files (YAML, schema `v2xw/scenario/1`)

A scenario file is the whole input to a run: the world, the fleet, the radio stack, the
security stack, the threats, the metrics and — optionally — the sweep that turns one file
into an experiment. There is no configuration outside it except the command line's output
paths, which is what makes a run reproducible from one artefact.

Every file here is meant to be **copied and edited**, so every one is commented like a
document rather than like a config: each states at the top what it measures, what it does
*not* measure, and why each non-obvious number is that number.

## The study library

| File | Question it answers | Sweep | Runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`pdr-vs-distance.yaml`](pdr-vs-distance.yaml) | How does delivery fall off with distance, and what does the propagation tier do to the curve? | propagation tier × 5 seeds | 10 |
| [`density-sweep-congestion.yaml`](density-sweep-congestion.yaml) | At what vehicle density does the channel congest, and where does the load land first? | 5 demand rates × 3 seeds | 15 |
| [`pseudonym-privacy.yaml`](pseudonym-privacy.yaml) | What does a pseudonym-change period cost in bytes, verification and detection? | 4 periods × 3 seeds | 12 |
| [`revocation-latency.yaml`](revocation-latency.yaml) | How long does each stage of a revocation take, and how big is the list? | 3 demand rates × 2 attacker fractions × 3 seeds | 18 |
| [`rat-comparison.yaml`](rat-comparison.yaml) | DSRC vs LTE-V2X vs NR-V2X: who delivers further, and what each loses frames to | radio technology × 5 seeds | 15 |

## The vertical slices and the scaling ladder

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`phase1-manhattan.yaml`](phase1-manhattan.yaml) | one vehicle, the real Manhattan import, signed BSMs, one metric |
| [`phase1-grid.yaml`](phase1-grid.yaml) | the same on a procedural Midtown-shaped grid, so determinism cannot be blamed on the extract |
| [`phase2-manhattan.yaml`](phase2-manhattan.yaml) | the Phase 2 *path*: a liar, a detector, a report, a roadside unit, the SCMS backend, a revocation |
| [`credential-lifecycle.yaml`](credential-lifecycle.yaml) | every US SCMS entity in the loop with the vehicles on a small grid — bootstrap, batches and top-ups through the LOP, renewal, reports, revocation, CRL — with the calendar compressed to five minutes; open the page's Backend view to watch it |
| [`ccms-lifecycle.yaml`](ccms-lifecycle.yaml) | the European counterpart: CAMs over GeoNetworking, the ECTL and CA-CRL from the Distribution Centre, butterfly tickets the AA cannot link to the enrolment, TS 103 759 reports and passive revocation at the EA |
| [`scale/`](scale/) | the wall-clock ladder, 2 to 10,000 vehicles, with what the bulk spawn costs in realism stated in `scale/base.yaml` |

## Running one

```sh
v2xw run scenarios/pdr-vs-distance.yaml --out runs/one          # a single run
v2xw experiment run scenarios/pdr-vs-distance.yaml --out runs/s # the whole sweep
v2xw experiment status scenarios/pdr-vs-distance.yaml --out runs/s
v2xw experiment resume scenarios/pdr-vs-distance.yaml --out runs/s
```

A sweep is **serial by default** (`v2xw_experiment::runner::DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY` is 1).
Raising it multiplies peak memory by the concurrency, because the engine's own loop
already uses the machine's cores inside one run; this project has lost a wave of work to
exactly that. The resume journal is what makes an interrupted sweep survivable, not what
makes over-subscription acceptable.

Three of the five studies need `worlds/cache/manhattan.osm.xml`, which is git-ignored: it
is 30 MB of OSM XML for the build decision D7 bounding box (`-73.9900, 40.7440, -73.9680,
40.7620`, 13,553 ways), downloaded from any OSM mirror and saved at that path. Replace the
`world` block with the procedural one from `pdr-vs-distance.yaml` to run without it.

## Rules the scenario validator enforces, that a new file trips over first

The validator returns **every** problem at once, each naming the field and the conflict.
These are the ones that catch people:

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| `exporters` must be empty | the engine has no exporter stage; exporting is `v2xw run --record` and `v2xw export`. A list here would be silently ignored, so it is refused instead |
| `net.layer` must be `wsmp` | nothing composes a network layer: a frame goes from the signer to the MAC with no header between them, so `gn-btp` would not be the thing that ran |
| `messages.sets` ⊆ {`bsm`, `cam`} | `ServiceSet` has a flag for each and nothing else, so any other set names a generator that does not exist |
| `messages.codec_tier` must be `uper` | the node runtime encodes real UPER unconditionally; nothing selects the size model |
| `actors.vru` must be all zeros | nothing spawns a pedestrian or a cyclist yet, so the three fields would select a population that never exists |
| `radio.tiers.focus` must be absent | one tier runs for the whole world; a focus region would be quietly ignored |
| `phy: high` requires `mac: high` | a frame-level PHY decides an outcome per frame, and a coarser MAC does not schedule frames at that granularity |
| `propagation: abstract` requires `phy: abstract` | an abstract propagation model returns a probability, and a link-budget PHY needs a power |
| `time.mobility_step_ms` ∈ [10, 100] | no mobility provider is calibrated below 10 ms, and the constant-velocity extrapolation between steps stops being accurate above 100 ms |
| exactly one of `fraction`, `count`, `actor_ids` per attacker | two would need a rule for which wins |
| `pseudonym_change.period_s` required when `strategy: time` | there is no default period, and a defaulted one would set a whole run's unlinkability invisibly |
| every `experiment.sweep` path must resolve in the **serialised** scenario | a sweep can only replace a value that is already there. A field that is `Option` and `None` is not serialised, so set it in the base before sweeping it |

That last one is the one that costs an afternoon. `security.pseudonym_change.period_s`,
`actors.vehicles.demand.rate_veh_per_h` and `threats.attackers[0].fraction` are all
optional fields: a sweep over any of them needs the base file to set it, which is why each
study file sets its swept fields to a real base value rather than leaving them out.

## Overlays

`meta.base` names a sibling file to inherit from, and the overlay is merged field by field
(`v2xw_engine::scenario::merge`). `scale/10.yaml` is three lines on top of
`scale/base.yaml`. Use it for a ladder of one parameter; use `experiment.sweep` for a
factorial. An overlay changes the scenario hash, a sweep cell changes the run seed as
well — the plan derives one seed per (slot, replication) and reuses it across cells, which
is common random numbers.

## Writing a new one

Start from the study whose shape matches yours, then:

1. **Say what it does not measure.** Every file here has that section, and in three of the
   five it is the longest one. A scenario that does not state its omissions produces a
   figure whose reader supplies their own.
2. **Justify every number that is not a default**, in place. "60 s" is not a duration, it
   is a claim that 60 s is long enough for the mechanism under study to happen.
3. **Hold everything but the swept axis fixed**, and say so where it would be tempting not
   to.
4. **Check that your sweep can differ.** A swept field the engine does not read produces
   identical cells and reads as a null result. `rat-comparison.yaml` was that failure
   mode until `radio.rat` was wired; the page's key-status table says which keys are.
