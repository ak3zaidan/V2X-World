/**
 * Static world construction from a decoded `vwp-world/1` payload (docs/protocol/vwp-v1.md §4).
 *
 * 09-ui §4 asks for "merged static geometry per tile … unzoomed = one drawable per category, zoomed =
 * per-tile drawables with quadtree culling" for roads, and `BatchedMesh` with three LODs for
 * buildings. What is built here:
 *
 * - **Roads, junctions, crossings, landuse** are merged into **one vertex-coloured mesh per tile**
 *   rather than one per tile *per category*. A 2 km world at the default 300 m tile is 7×7 tiles, so
 *   the whole ground plan is ~49 draw calls instead of ~245, and three's own frustum culling drops
 *   the off-screen ones. Category is carried in the vertex colour, which costs three floats a vertex
 *   and saves a material switch.
 * - **Lane markings** are a second mesh per tile (unlit, polygon-offset) so `overlay.set
 *   {lane_markings: false}` is one `visible = false` per tile and nothing else.
 * - **Buildings** go into a single `THREE.BatchedMesh`, one geometry per building: its real
 *   footprint extruded, with a roof and a parapet. There used to be three LODs, and the far one was
 *   the footprint's *axis-aligned bounding box* — on Manhattan's grid, which runs 29° off north, a
 *   box that swallows half of every street around the block, so from 700 m out the traffic drove
 *   through solid walls. The near/mid switch popped the parapet at 180 m. One exact geometry
 *   costs fewer vertices than the three did together and cannot pop. If `BatchedMesh` cannot be
 *   built — the vertex budget is exceeded, or a three build without multi-draw support throws —
 *   the builder falls back to baking the shells into the per-tile meshes and reports
 *   {@link WorldRenderer.buildingBackend} as `"merged"`.
 *
 * Also here: the ground plane, the gradient sky, and a sun/hemisphere rig driven by a time-of-day
 * parameter, plus the building occupancy grid that `cameras.ts` uses for `keepCameraOutsideBuildings`.
