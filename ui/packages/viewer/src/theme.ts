/**
 * Palettes and render tuning. 09-ui §10 asks for light and dark themes and a colour-blind-safe
 * categorical palette for the four actor states with shape redundancy; `overlays.ts` supplies the
 * redundant marker shapes and the state colours below are the palette.
 *
 * ## What "colour-blind-safe" means here, precisely
 *
 * Every entry of `actorState` is one of three things, and `test/theme.test.ts` asserts it:
 *
 * 1. a colour from the Okabe–Ito qualitative set (Okabe & Ito 2008) exactly;
 * 2. an Okabe–Ito colour scaled in *linear* sRGB — same hue and saturation, lower luminance —
 *    because the set is designed for a white background and some of it has to be darkened to clear
 *    the WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.11 non-text contrast floor of 3:1 against the light theme's own
 *    background;
 * 3. a near-neutral grey, for `benign` and `selected`, which are deliberately *not* categorical
 *    hues: benign is "nothing to report" and selected is a transient highlight.
 *
 * On top of that the test simulates the three dichromacies (Viénot 1999, in linear sRGB through
 * HPE LMS) and requires a pairwise CIEDE2000 distance of at least 15 between the four state
 * colours under every one of them, plus 3:1 contrast against the theme background. A palette that
 * merely *comes from* Okabe–Ito is not automatically safe once entries are darkened or a neutral is
 * added, so the property is measured rather than asserted by provenance.
 *
 * The light theme's `reported` used to be `0xb08900`, a gold that is in no palette and that
 * collapses onto `attacker` (vermillion) at ΔE00 2.9 under deuteranopia while failing the contrast
 * floor at 2.77:1; it is now the genuine Okabe–Ito blue. `revoked` is the Okabe–Ito reddish purple
 * darkened, in both themes, because a mid-lightness purple is indistinguishable from the neutral
 * `benign` grey to a protanope or a deuteranope.

 * ## Why the surfaces are lighter than a dark basemap would paint them
 *
 * These values are consumed as *albedo*, not as pixels: the renderer converts each one to linear
 * space, multiplies by the light rig and tone-maps the result, so a surface authored at 0x2a3138
 * left the screen at roughly 0x2b2b2b. That is a fine road on a plan view, where the only job is to
 * sit behind a bright lane marking. At street level it was the whole lower half of the frame, and a
 * building wall at 0x39424d beside it was indistinguishable from the sky — the review's "a few
 * white strips in a black void". The street-level surfaces (`ground`, `road`, `sidewalk`,
 * `junction`, `parking`, `building`, `buildingRoof`) are therefore authored for how they *render*
 * under the rig rather than for how they look in a swatch.
 *
 * `background`, `actorState` and `actorCategory` are unchanged and deliberately so: the first is
 * what `test/theme.test.ts` measures the palette's 3:1 non-text contrast against, and the second
 * two are the colour-blind-safe categorical palette the same test measures under all three
 * dichromacies. Nothing here may move them.
