/**
 * The viewer: one scene, one renderer, one camera.
 *
 * 09-ui §3 is the whole reason this class looks the way it does. "The 2D map and the 3D world are the
 * same Three.js scene. The 2D view is a top-down camera; the 3D view is a chase/dashboard/free-fly
 * camera. The 'click and fly down' interaction is therefore a camera path, not a scene switch, and
 * every overlay exists in both views." So there is exactly one `THREE.Scene`, one `WebGLRenderer` and
 * one `PerspectiveCamera` here, and `map` is a camera mode rather than a separate renderer, canvas or
 * scene graph. Nothing in {@link Viewer} tears down or rebuilds anything when the mode changes.
 *
 * Render profile, from 09-ui §4: pixel ratio capped at 1.5, ACES filmic tone mapping, sRGB output,
 * 2,048² PCF soft shadows.
 *
 * The loop is a `requestAnimationFrame` callback with a fixed-step accumulator. Poses are sampled at
 * `fixedClock + residual`, so the pose clock advances in whole {@link ViewerOptions.fixedStepSeconds}
 * increments plus a sub-step residual, which is what makes 10 Hz deltas look like 60 fps motion
 * (`interp.ts`). Camera smoothing runs on the real frame `dt` because `1 − exp(−λ·dt)` is already
 * frame-rate independent — substepping it would only cost time.
 *
 * Headless use: pass {@link ViewerOptions.createRenderer} to substitute anything satisfying
 * {@link ViewerRenderer}, and drive {@link Viewer.renderFrame} by hand instead of {@link Viewer.start}.
