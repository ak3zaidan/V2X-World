/**
 * Pose interpolation.
 *
 * Deltas arrive at the mobility step (10 Hz in the reference scenarios, `Hello.mobility_step_ns`,
 * §3.1) but the renderer runs at 60 fps. 09-ui §2 calls for "the render loop samples the ring at its
 * own cadence and interpolates between the two latest samples"; this is that, without the
 * `SharedArrayBuffer` ring (the viewer is handed a `PoseBuffer` that the client or the worker has
 * already brought up to date, and takes its own snapshot of it).
 *
 * A short **history** of snapshots is kept ({@link HISTORY}), not just the latest two, and the
 * sampler evaluates the segment that actually brackets the render time. With only two snapshots a
 * frame that arrived while the render clock was still inside the previous segment forced the
 * sampler onto the new segment with a negative blend factor — an extrapolation *backwards along the
 * new chord*, which is a visible snap at every keyframe the render clock had not yet reached. The
 * buffers are preallocated and rotated, so steady-state capture and sampling allocate nothing.
 *
 * ## The motion model
 *
 * Between two snapshots the position is a **cubic Hermite** curve whose end tangents are the
 * velocities the engine reported (`speed` along `heading`, §3.3.2), so the path leaves each
 * snapshot in the direction the vehicle is pointing and at the speed it is going. A linear blend
 * has a velocity discontinuity at every snapshot — ten times a second — which is exactly the
 * stepping a followed vehicle shows in a chase camera, and it cuts every turn along its chord. The
 * tangents are *limited* against the chord (Fritsch & Carlson 1980, "Monotone Piecewise Cubic
 * Interpolation", SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 17(2): a tangent of at most three chords keeps a monotone
 * segment monotone), so a speed that disagrees with the positions — a vehicle reported at 11 m/s
 * that did not move — can never make the curve overshoot or loop.
 *
 * Heading is a monotone cubic on the unwrapped angle, with tangents from the neighbouring
 * snapshots where they exist (Catmull–Rom), so the yaw rate is continuous too; it crosses the ±180°
 * seam the short way.
 *
 * Any remaining discontinuity at a snapshot boundary — the sampler had to extrapolate past the
 * newest snapshot and the next one disagrees — is **blended out** rather than shown: the difference
 * between what was on screen and what the new data says for the same instant is carried as a
 * per-actor offset that decays with a {@link ERROR_BLEND_SECONDS} time constant. Offsets larger
 * than {@link PoseInterpolatorOptions.blendMaxMetres} are real jumps and are snapped.
 *
 * ## The clock
 *
 * A snapshot is dated by **sim time** — `PoseBuffer.simTimeNs`, §3.3.1/§3.4.1, the only authoritative
 * clock in the system. The engine is forbidden from reading a wall clock anywhere (ADR 0004) for
 * exactly this reason, and the viewer honours the same discipline as far as the data allows: the
 * instant a frame *arrived* is used for one thing only, deciding that the stream has gone quiet.
 *
 * Sampling therefore needs a map from the viewer's monotonic clock to sim time. That map is a
 * straight line, `sim ≈ anchorSim + (clock − anchorClock) · rate`, maintained in {@link
 * PoseInterpolator.capture} by a minimum-delay filter: a frame that arrives *earlier* relative to
 * its sim time than the line predicts re-anchors it immediately (it is the least-delayed evidence
 * available), while a later one only drags the line by {@link PoseInterpolatorOptions.clockGain} of
 * the error. `rate` (sim seconds per clock second, which is exactly `run.speed`) is measured over a
 * multi-second baseline so slow playback is followed without ever being confused for a stall.
 *
 * The render clock then *follows* that line rather than taking its value: it advances at `rate · dt`
 * with a bounded correction towards the estimate, so a re-anchor, a new rate or a re-measured
 * interval changes the clock's speed by a few per cent and never its position.
 *
 * ## Discontinuities
 *
 * A snapshot dated *before* the newest one, or far after it, is a seek, a rewind or a new run: the
 * history is dropped and the new snapshot starts a fresh one. (The two-snapshot sampler instead
 * blended across the seek with a 1e-6 s span and a clamped blend factor of −1.2, putting every actor
 * that had moved less than the teleport distance up to 1.2 chords *away from both* poses.) A
 * snapshot at the *same* sim time as the newest — a keyframe that repeats the step a delta already
 * carried, or a delta the pose buffer refused — replaces it in place.
 *
 * ## Delay, extrapolation and the stall
 *
 * Every window is a multiple of the **measured snapshot interval**, never an absolute number of
 * seconds: a 2 s cadence (0.05x playback, a keyframe-only run, a congested link) has to interpolate
 * exactly as well as a 0.1 s one. Outside the history the sampler dead-reckons from the newest
 * snapshot's velocity, but it *glides to a stop*: the render clock's advance decays linearly to zero
 * and the total overshoot converges to {@link PoseInterpolatorOptions.maxExtrapolationSteps}
 * intervals. When the owner knows the stream is paused or finished ({@link
 * PoseInterpolator.setHeld}) there is no extrapolation at all: the scene shows exactly the newest
 * snapshot, which is the state the engine is actually in.
