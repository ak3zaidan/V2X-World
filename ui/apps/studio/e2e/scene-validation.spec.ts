/**
 * Visual validation: the properties a picture of the simulator has to have, checked against the
 * real framebuffer in a real browser.
 *
 * Three things the owner saw and reported are the reason this file exists:
 *
 *   1. "I don't really see any cars moving" — the aerial view drew the network and the buildings
 *      and no vehicles.
 *   2. "the camera is positioned weird" — the chase view showed two dark planes and a yellow line,
 *      with no car in sight.
 *   3. `radios 0` in the inspector, beside `bytes_air 1468 B/s` in the panel next to it.
 *
 * None of the three is a crash, a console error or a failing unit test. All three are statements
 * about pixels, or about numbers printed next to pixels, and all three went unnoticed until somebody
 * looked. So this suite looks: it reads the WebGL drawing buffer, and it compares what it finds
 * there with where the scene graph says things are.
 *
 * It is not a pixel diff against a golden image. A golden image goes red on every legitimate change
 * and says nothing about whether the picture is right. Every assertion here is either
 *
 *   • *differential* — hide one group of objects, redraw, and require the pixels to change in the
 *     place the projection predicted, which survives a new road colour or a different building LOD;
 *     or
 *   • *relational* — a number the interface prints must equal the number in the stream it describes.
 *
 * The differential measurements are taken on a **paused** run. A live scene moves between two reads
 * of the framebuffer, and that motion reads as a difference: one measurement here showed 24% of a
 * patch changing between two identical draws of a running scene. Every probe therefore takes three
 * reads — visible, hidden, visible again — and reports both the difference the hiding made and the
 * difference two identical draws made, so the noise floor is part of the result rather than an
 * assumption about it.
 *
 * The companion suite in `packages/viewer/test/scene-correctness.test.ts` carries the half that
 * needs no GPU: camera placement, instance accounting, framing geometry.

 * Hide something, redraw, read the pixels back, put it the way it was, and redraw again.
 *
 * It has to run as one synchronous task: `requestAnimationFrame` must not interleave between the
 * draw and the `readPixels`, because three renders with `preserveDrawingBuffer: false` and the
 * drawing buffer is only guaranteed between a draw and the next composite.
 *
 * `Viewer.renderFrame` rewrites `ActorRenderer.hiddenActorId` from the camera mode at the top of
 * every frame, so setting that field from outside is silently undone — an earlier version of this
 * file did exactly that and measured nothing but scene motion for its trouble. Group visibility is
 * the lever that survives a frame.
 *
 * The overlay layer is switched off for the duration of the probe — all of it but the vehicle
 * marks. Transmit pulses, links and the heatmap animate on the *render* clock, not the simulation
 * clock, so they keep moving on a paused run: they put 20% of a patch in motion between two
 * otherwise identical draws, which swamps the few hundred pixels a vehicle covers at map altitude.
 * They are a separate layer with its own question, and this probe's question is whether the
 * vehicles and the buildings are drawn.
 *
 * The vehicle marks are not an overlay in that sense: at map altitude the mark **is** how a vehicle
 * is drawn (`ActorLocatorOverlay`, a constant-angular-size dot, because the 5 m body projects to
 * three pixels however correctly it is rendered). They stay on, and hiding "the actors" hides both
 * the bodies and their marks. Switching the whole layer off measured the body alone, which the
 * design never meant to be visible from 1,700 m — the test and the design disagreed, and the test
 * reported 16-20 px against a floor it could only meet with a bigger car.
