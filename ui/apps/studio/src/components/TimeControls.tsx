/**
 * The transport bar: where the run is, what it is doing, and the five controls that move it.
 *
 * Every control is one JSON-RPC call — `run.resume`, `run.pause`, `run.step`, `run.speed`,
 * `run.seek`, `run.start` — which is what makes the copilot's tool surface identical to the UI's.
 * What changed is that the bar now tells the truth about all six.
 *
 * # What it used to say
 *
 * `00:00:00.000 / 00:01:00.000 · idle`, against a server reporting `state: "finished"` at 60.1
 * seconds. Three errors in one line, all the same error: the 2 s `run.status` poll went through the
 * socket, the socket closes when a run ends, the poll failed, and the store kept the zeroes it was
 * initialised with. The bar reported the absence of an answer as a fact about the run. The poll now
 * falls back to HTTP (`StudioEngine.request`), so those figures are the engine's.
 *
 * # What it says now
 *
 *  * **The state in words**, from the same description the header chip reads (`lib/status.ts`), so
 *    the two cannot disagree. Never a wire token: `idle` is not a word about a simulation.
 *  * **A disabled control says why.** Which controls the engine will accept depends on the state it
 *    is in, and `state/transport.ts` holds those rules with the engine's own refusals beside them.
 *    A greyed button with no tooltip is a dead end; "Pause first — the engine refuses a step while
 *    the run is moving" is an instruction.
 *  * **How much of the span exists.** The bar draws the part of the run that has been simulated
 *    separately from the part that has not, because dragging into the second one is refused.
 *  * **A refused seek is reported.** `run.seek` outside the produced range fails with `-32003`,
 *    whose `data` carries the range that *would* have worked. That used to be swallowed by a bare
 *    `catch`, so the thumb snapped back and nothing was said. It is now shown, and the range it
 *    reports is remembered and drawn.
 *  * **Restart is here**, not only in the header, because this is the bar you are looking at when a
 *    run ends. It rewinds, reopens the closed stream and resumes, in that order
 *    (`StudioEngine.startRun`).
 *
 * The scrub bar commits on release, not on change. React maps `onChange` on an
 * `<input type="range">` onto the DOM `input` event, so a plain `onChange={seek}` fires once for
 * every step the thumb crosses: a single drag across a 300 s run at the reference 0.1 s mobility
 * step is 3,000 `run.seek` calls, each one pausing the run, each one followed by a `run.status`
 * poll. While the pointer (or an arrow key) is down the value is held in local state, which also
 * stops the 5 Hz stream from fighting the thumb; one `run.seek` goes out when the gesture ends.
 *
 * Two further cases the bar carries:
 *
 *  * **A recording takes it over.** With a local recording open the scrub drives the WebAssembly
 *    reader instead of `run.seek`, over the recording's own span, and the transport is not merely
 *    disabled but gone: a recording has no clock to start, and an inert Play button invites a press
 *    that can never do anything.
 *  * **Side B follows.** While the comparison view is synchronised, every control that moves side
 *    A's clock moves side B's afterwards, never in parallel (a seek's frames precede its reply, and
 *    two in flight would interleave).
