/**
 * The run's state, said in words, with the button that resolves it.
 *
 * Three pieces, all reading one description from `lib/status.ts`:
 *
 *  * {@link StatusPill} — the chip in the header. Sentence case, never a wire token.
 *  * {@link StatusBanner} — the sentence over the viewport, shown only when the state is not "a run
 *    playing normally". This is the part that was missing: a finished run used to present the word
 *    "closed" and a Connect button that appeared dead, with no explanation anywhere on the page.
 *  * {@link useStatus} — the description itself, for anything else that needs it.
 *
 * The chip keeps the wire tokens in `data-state` and `data-run-state` rather than in its text, so
 * the protocol state is still one query away for a test or a debugger without being the headline a
 * researcher reads.
