/**
 * The replay path with no engine at all: `crates/v2xw-wasm` driven from the Studio.
 *
 * 09-ui §7 fixes the rule this module keeps:
 *
 * > The replay reader is the same Rust code compiled natively (served by
 * > `v2xw serve --replay file.mcap`) or to WASM (static hosting), and emits the identical VWP
 * > stream, so the Studio has no replay-specific code path.
 *
 * So there is no second decoder here. The WebAssembly reader hands back the recorded `Keyframe`
 * and `Delta` frames **byte for byte** as the live engine put them on the wire (`keyframePtr` /
 * `deltaPtr` in `crates/v2xw-wasm/src/js.rs`, vwp-v1 §7.2), and those go through the same
 * `decodeMessage` and the same `PoseBuffer.applyKeyframe` / `applyDelta` the socket path uses. What
 * this module adds is the two things a browser needs and a file system does not: loading the
 * `wasm-bindgen` module, and driving the ask-and-retry range loop.
 *
 * # Why the frames and not the columns
 *
 * The reader also exposes its resolved pose columns as pointers into linear memory, which is
 * cheaper. It is not used here: those columns would need a second copy of the dequantisation rules
 * of §3.2, and two implementations of §3.2 is exactly the thing 09-ui §7 forbids. A recording's
 * keyframe is a few hundred kilobytes and a seek touches one of them, so the copy is affordable and
 * the arithmetic stays in one place. `test/replay.test.ts` pins that the frames, not the columns,
 * are what reaches the pose buffer.
 *
 * # What a recording does not carry
 *
 * §7.1 keeps `WorldChunk` out of a recording, and `ReplayEngine::open` in `crates/v2xw-server`
 * takes the world as a separate argument for the same reason. So a recording opened here has poses
 * and signals but no world geometry until one is supplied — from the run it is being compared
 * against, or from a `.vwb` file beside the recording. {@link LocalReplay} reports that rather than
 * drawing actors over an implied empty city.
