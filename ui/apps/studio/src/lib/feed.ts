/**
 * The followed node's message feed, as the message panel shows it.
 *
 * The engine pushes `node.feed` a few times a second while a vehicle is followed (vwp-v1 §6.7,
 * §6.14): the frames it put on the air, the receptions it resolved, and its five queues. This module
 * keeps them — a ring of the newest {@link RING} per direction — and answers what the panel asks:
 * which rows pass the filters, which message is open, and how its octets lay out in hex.
 *
 * # The open message is pinned
 *
 * Opening a row used to keep only the row's key, and the detail was drawn from whichever row had that
 * key in the newest refresh's first twelve. A BSM stream at 10 Hz pushed the opened row out of those
 * twelve one to two seconds after the click, depending on where in the once-a-second refresh the click
 * fell — so the same click showed its fields in one pass and nothing in the next. Here the opened
 * message is a copy of the entry itself: new pushes, the ring dropping it, a filter hiding its row or
 * the panel re-mounting do not take it away. Only choosing another message, or following another
 * node, does.
 *
 * # Pause
 *
 * Pausing freezes what is shown and keeps receiving: pushes are held, counted, and applied on resume,
 * so nothing is lost by pausing and the table does not move under the pointer.
 *
 * # Hover
 *
 * The rows are newest first, so every push used to insert rows at the top and slide the one under the
 * pointer down a line or two, several times a second: the row a reader aimed at was not the row they
 * clicked (QA, 2026-09-24). While the pointer is over the list the feed holds its pushes exactly as a
 * pause does, and applies them when the pointer leaves. It is a separate flag from `paused`, so leaving
 * the list does not resume a feed the reader paused on purpose.
 *
 * Framework- and DOM-free, so it is tested in plain Node (test/feed.test.ts).
