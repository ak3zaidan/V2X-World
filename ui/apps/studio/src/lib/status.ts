/**
 * What the Studio is doing, in one sentence, with the button that resolves it.
 *
 * Every state the app can be in is enumerated here — the seven connection states
 * `@vwp/protocol`'s client publishes (`idle`, `connecting`, `handshaking`, `streaming`,
 * `reconnecting`, `closed`, `failed`) crossed with the seven run states the engine reports on
 * `run.status` (`idle`, `loading`, `running`, `paused`, `seeking`, `finished`, `error`), plus the
 * two states that have no connection at all: a recording open from a file, and no engine found.
 *
 * It exists because the interface used to print the connection token and stop there. A run that had
 * simply reached its end showed the word "closed" beside a Connect button that appeared dead — the
 * engine knew perfectly well (`run.status` answers `state: "finished"`), the page had the
 * information, and said none of it. The rule this module enforces is: name the state in words a
 * researcher can act on, and put the action next to it.
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately so: it takes a snapshot and returns text, so the whole state table is
 * checkable in a unit test without a socket, a server or a browser.
