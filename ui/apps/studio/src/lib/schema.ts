/**
 * The standard scenario fields, used when the engine does not publish its own list.

 * on — and worse, it implied the value would not make sense without reading that document.
 *
 * Every pointer is checked against the document a real engine serves on `scenario.get` —
 * `scenarios/phase1-manhattan.yaml`, resolved. The list previously addressed `/traffic/actors`,
 * `/time/step_ms`, `/world/source` as a string, `/world/bbox`, `/security/profile` and
 * `/security/attackers/share`, none of which exist in that document, and it typed `/seed` as an
 * integer against a value of `"0x000000c0ffee5eed"`. So two thirds of the form was blank against a
 * scenario that configures every one of those things, and a blank box labelled "Attacker share"
 * reads as "this scenario has no attackers in it" when what it means is that the form was looking
 * in the wrong place. The seed — the one field that decides whether a result can be reproduced —
 * showed as empty.
 *
 * Labels stay in the user's language and the pointer is what travels, so nothing is lost by a
 * researcher not knowing that "fitted with radios" is spelt `equipped_fraction`.
