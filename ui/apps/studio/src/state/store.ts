/**
 * The Studio's React-visible state.
 *
 * Everything here is a *projection*: the hot structures (pose buffer, interpolator, instance
 * matrices, telemetry rings) live in `engine.ts` and in `@vwp/viewer`, and are copied in at 5 Hz.
 * Nothing in this file is on a 60 fps path.
 *
 * The 5 Hz beat is unconditional, though, so a setter that always stores a fresh object re-renders
 * every subscriber 5x a second whether or not the numbers moved. The setters the flush drives —
 * `setStats`, `setFrameCounts`, `setRun`, `setTelemetry`, `setMetricProjection`,
 * `addTimelineMarks` — therefore return the previous state unchanged when the content matches;
 * Zustand skips the notification entirely in that case. `bumpSeries` is the deliberate exception:
 * it *is* the 5 Hz beat the sparklines and plots redraw on (09-ui §4).
