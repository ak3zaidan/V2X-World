/**
 * The imperative half of the Studio.
 *
 * React owns none of the hot path. This module owns the `VwpClient` (docs/protocol/vwp-v1.md §1),
 * the `Viewer`, the decoded world, the provenance dictionary (§3.8), the telemetry ring buffers and
 * the metric history; it pushes a small, throttled projection of that state into the Zustand store
 * so the panels re-render at a human rate (09-ui §4: "HUD updates 5 Hz for DOM, 20 Hz for
 * sparklines") while poses, deltas and instance writes stay on the 60 fps path inside `@vwp/viewer`.
 *
 * The engine serves the built Studio in production (09-ui §9), so every endpoint is same-origin and
 * relative: `/vwp/v1`, `/rpc`, `/world/{hash}.vwb`. `vite.config.ts` proxies those three in dev.

   * Start, or rewind and start again — one coherent action whatever state the run is in.
   *
   * `run.start` on its own is not enough, because each of the engine's refusals is a state check
   * and the sequence has to satisfy all of them:
   *
   *  1. **Pause first if the run is going.** `run.start` on a running run is refused outright
   *     (`RunAlreadyRunning`), so "Run again" mid-run would fail with a JSON-RPC error.
   *  2. **`run.start {paused: true}`**, which rewinds — `LiveEngine::restart` clears the timeline,
   *     the history and the cursor, and deliberately keeps the run id and the symbol table — and
   *     leaves the clock at zero rather than moving.
   *  3. **Reopen the stream if it is down**, which it is in the case this exists for: a run that
   *     ended closed its socket. Asking for `paused` in step 2 is what makes this safe. Started
   *     running, a run at high speed (or at `speed: 0`, unthrottled) can reach its end before the
   *     socket is back, and the user would press "Run again" and be handed another finished run —
   *     the original complaint, reproduced by its own fix.
   *  4. **`run.resume`**, legal now because the run is paused, and only now with a viewer attached
   *     to receive the first keyframe.
   *
   * Returns the state the engine reports at the end, so a caller can say what happened.
