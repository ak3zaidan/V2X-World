/**
 * The comparison view's imperative half — Phase 5's "two runs side by side".
 *
 * 09-ui §6 asks for "two to four runs side by side with synchronised time, difference overlays for
 * metrics, and manifest diff". This builds the two-run case, which is the one a researcher actually
 * uses: a run against a baseline, or two recordings.
 *
 * # Why side B is its own connection, not a second `run_id`
 *
 * The obvious route is `metrics.query {runs: [...]}` (§6.12) and `experiment.compare`. Neither is
 * available: §6.15 reserves `experiment.compare` for a later minor version, and the real engine's
 * `metrics_query` (`crates/v2xw-server/src/rpc.rs`) ignores the `runs` argument because a server
 * serves exactly one run — `run.status` with a foreign `run_id` is `-32000 RUN_NOT_FOUND` there.
 * That is not a gap to work around; it is the architecture. One run per server means a second run
 * is a second *source*, and the browser can hold two:
 *
 *  * `"engine"` — a second VWP connection, to another `v2xw-server` on another port. This side
 *    carries everything a run carries, metric samples included, so the difference view is real.
 *    (`ReplayEngine` would let that second server replay a recording, but `v2xw-server`'s binary
 *    has no `--replay` flag yet — `serve_replay` is library-only — so today this means a second
 *    live run.)
 *  * `"replay"` — a recording opened from a local file and read by `crates/v2xw-wasm`, with no
 *    server at all (`lib/replay.ts`). Poses and signals, because §7.1 is what a recording holds;
 *    the difference view says so rather than showing zeros.
 *
 * # Synchronised time
 *
 * One scrub drives both, on *simulated* time, through {@link CompareController.seekTo}: side A gets
 * `run.seek` (§6.6) and side B gets either its own `run.seek` or a WebAssembly seek, which §7.3
 * costs one chunk and one keyframe period of deltas. `offsetNs` aligns two runs that do not share
 * a `t0`; it is zero for two runs of the same scenario.
 *
 * # The camera
 *
 * Side B has its own `Viewer` — two canvases, two scenes — and {@link mirrorCameraFrom} copies A's
 * `CameraState` onto it. Copying the *state* rather than the camera object is what makes the two
 * views comparable when the worlds differ in extent: the mode, the look-at target, the altitude,
 * the chase distance and the bearing all transfer, and each viewer keeps its own aspect ratio.
