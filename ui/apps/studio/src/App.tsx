/**
 * The Studio shell: scenario and setup on the left, the viewport in the centre with the time
 * controls under it, the inspector on the right, and the plots strip across the bottom.
 *
 * # The header
 *
 * It carries four things, and only four: what the run is doing, which scenario it is, where the
 * simulated clock is, and the one button worth pressing next. Everything else the header used to
 * carry — the engine build string, the protocol version, the run id, the frame-rate figures, the
 * two 64-character digests — moved into the Details disclosure, which is a click away and copies
 * each identifier in full. Eleven facts on one line is a diagnostic readout, not a title bar.
 *
 * # Saying what is happening
 *
 * Every state the connection and the run can be in gets a sentence and, where one helps, the
 * button that resolves it (`lib/status.ts`, `components/Status.tsx`). The case that drove this: a
 * run reaching its end used to leave the word "closed" beside a Connect button that appeared dead,
 * while the engine was answering `state: "finished"` on a transport the page had stopped using. It
 * now says the run finished and offers to run it again — and that button works from a closed page,
 * because `engine.startRun()` falls back to HTTP.
 *
 * # Two things not in the original sketch
 *
 *  * **The engine target.** The Studio does not assume the fixture. On mount it resolves a base URL
 *    with `lib/target.ts` and the Details panel says which implementation answered. That readout is
 *    the point: a plot of fixture values and a plot of simulation results must not look the same.
 *  * **The comparison pane.** With side B open the centre splits in two, one `Viewer` each, and the
 *    time controls underneath drive both.
