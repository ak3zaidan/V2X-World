//! Local, on-node misbehaviour detection: the legacy twelve, the two gated checks and the
//! soft tracker feature, with every threshold a declared card parameter.
//!
//! # Normalisation
//!
//! Every detector returns a score normalised so that **≈ 1 is its firing threshold**
//! (`detnorm ≈ 1 at threshold`, 01-inventory §3.3). That is what makes a score comparable
//! across checks whose raw units are metres, degrees, seconds and counts, and it is the
//! contract the machine-learning dataset's `detnorm_*` columns depend on. A check fires
//! when its score has been ≥ 1 for [`DetectorParams::min_consecutive`] messages in a row
//! from the same signer, which is the legacy streak gate: a single GNSS outlier is one
//! sample, a real kinematic attack persists.
//!
//! # Belief only
//!
//! Every input is an [`crate::obs::ObservedMessage`], the receiver's own
//! [`crate::obs::SelfBelief`] and, for the map check, the node's own map store. There is
//! no path from here to the world: see [`crate::obs`]. Two consequences are worth naming
//! because they are the honest cost of the firewall:
//!
//! * **`acceptanceRangeThreshold` compares against the receiver's own configured range**,
//!   not against the true propagation distance — which is why the legacy engine's own note
//!   says an RSU with a longer range must use *its* range or it flags honest distant
//!   senders.
//! * **`sybilCoLocation` counts only what this receiver heard.** The legacy engine
//!   computed the co-location census over *every broadcast in the step*
//!   (`run.py`, `cells = Counter(… for b in broadcasts)`), which is a global view no
//!   single receiver has; the JVM reference does it per receiver over a 1.5 s window. This
//!   port is per receiver. A Sybil whose ghosts are heard by different receivers is
//!   therefore harder to catch here than in the legacy engine, which is a real property of
//!   the attack and not a regression. See the crate report.
//!
//! # Measured against the legacy engine
//!
//! `tests/legacy_engine_compare.rs` extracts the legacy detection pass out of
//! `legacy/scms_sim_ref/mock_pipeline/run.py` at test time, executes it, and hands both
//! implementations the same 1 330-message claim trace covering all 28 legacy attack
//! renderings. **Thirteen of the fourteen checks reproduce the legacy score on every
//! message**, to the 1e-3 quantum both sides round to, and the fired set — streak gate and
//! reason ordering included — agrees on every message.
//!
//! The fourteenth is `sybilCoLocation`, and the comparison sharpens the divergence above
//! into two mechanisms rather than one:
//!
//! 1. the census here is **per receiver**, as declared; and
//! 2. it is **incremental within the step**. The legacy engine builds `cells` over the
//!    whole step *before* the detection pass, so every message of that step sees the full
//!    count; this port counts a claim as it arrives, so the attacker's own beacon sees a
//!    census of one and the *n*-th ghost sees *n*.
//!
//! Measured on that trace: 210 of 1 330 messages disagree, **all of them scoring lower
//! here, none higher**, with a largest shortfall of 1.5 — six of a seven-identity Sybil's
//! certificates missed on the message that arrived first. The direction is the safe one
//! (this port under-accuses rather than over-accuses), and the fix, if the operating point
//! is ever to match the legacy corpus, is to score a step's messages after the step's
//! census is complete rather than during it.
//!
//! One smaller note from the same comparison: the cell index is
//! [`v2xw_core::math::grid_index`], which rounds half away from zero, while the legacy
//! `round(cx / cell)` is Python's round-half-to-even. It can only differ on an exact tie.
//!
//! # What is deliberately soft
//!
//! `kalmanConsistency` is carried in the fingerprint and never fires on its own: a
//! constant-velocity tracker false-positives on a sustained curve, so promoting it to a
//! trigger would manufacture false accusations against honest vehicles going round
//! corners. The legacy engine says exactly this and so does the JVM reference.
//!
//! It has one failure mode the legacy engine cannot reach, and it is recorded here because
//! it is a *feature column* even though it is never a trigger. The tracker's velocity
//! update divides the residual by `dtk = max(1e-3, t − t_prev)`, so two messages from one
//! signer bearing the **same** received instant multiply the residual by 300. The legacy
//! engine emits one beacon per sender per step and so never produces such a pair; a
//! dual-stack node does — `v2xw_node::NodeConfig::default()` is `ServiceSet::BOTH`, and a
//! CAM and a BSM in one generation interval carry one signer and one claimed generation
//! time. Measured in `tests/common/sim.rs` with `BOTH`: 135 809 such pairs in a
//! 345 088-reception run and a `kalmanConsistency` that reached `inf`; with
//! `ServiceSet::SAE` the same run has none and the score peaks at 22. The arithmetic here
//! is the legacy arithmetic and is left alone; what the engine has to decide is whether a
//! receiver may be handed two beacons from one signer at one instant, and if so whether
//! this tracker should key on `(signer, message type)` or guard `dtk` at the generation
//! interval rather than at a millisecond.
