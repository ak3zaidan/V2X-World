//! The privacy observer: an adversary that never transmits, only listens, and measures how
//! long it can follow a vehicle across pseudonym changes (07-threats-and-detection.md §6).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The whole pseudonym scheme — twenty concurrent certificates a week, the change
//! strategies of 05-protocols.md §2.4, the silent periods, the mix zones, the butterfly key
//! expansion that makes the certificates unlinkable at issuance — is there to defeat
//! exactly one adversary: someone with receivers by the road who writes down what it hears.
//! Until something in the simulator *is* that adversary, every pseudonym parameter is
//! unfalsifiable: a run can change the change interval from 5 minutes to 5 seconds and no
//! number anywhere moves.
//!
//! This model is that adversary, and it emits the four quantities
//! 08-measurement-and-data.md §2.6 names: `linkability_rate`, `anonymity_set_size`,
//! `degree_of_anonymity` and `tracking_duration`.
//!
//! # What it can see
//!
//! Receptions. Nothing else. It has no credentials, transmits nothing, and every field it
//! reads is on an [`ObservedMessage`] — which is the same firewall every detector in this
//! crate sits behind, and it matters more here than anywhere: an observer that could ask
//! which vehicle a digest belonged to would report perfect tracking and prove nothing.
//!
//! # What it cannot know, and who supplies it
//!
//! **Whether a link is correct.** That is the ground-truth join, and this model never
//! makes it: [`crate::records::PrivacyLinkClaim`] carries the two digests and the
//! observer's own posterior, and the run declares the digest-to-actor map on the
//! ground-truth side exactly as `v2xw_metrics::detection::DetectionProvider::declare_subject`
//! already does for reports. `linkability_rate` is then correct links over pseudonym
//! changes, with the denominator coming from the `sec.cert` `change` events — which is why
//! the observer also emits a record when it *declines* to link, so the denominator is not
//! silently the numerator.
//!
//! # The tracker
//!
//! A constant-velocity predictor with a covariance that grows over a silence, and a
//! best-hypothesis association — the method of Wiedersheim, Ma, Kargl and Papadimitratos,
//! *Privacy in inter-vehicular networks: why simple pseudonym change is not enough*
//! (WONS 2010), whose result 07-threats-and-detection.md §6 cites: at 1 Hz beacons a change
//! interval of 4 s and 20 % penetration already yields near-100 % tracking success. A
//! simulator that cannot reproduce that finding is not measuring privacy.
//!
//! Every constant in the association is cited: the gate is `z · σ` with the legacy
//! `detector_z_threshold` of 3.0 and the legacy `consistency_threshold_m` of 5.0 as σ's
//! floor, the covariance grows by the plausible-acceleration bound of 04-models.md §14
//! (3 m/s²) over the silence, and the silence itself is bounded by the longest cited
//! silent period, PRESERVE's 13 s (05-protocols.md §2.4).
//!
//! # Anonymity
//!
//! Ψ is the candidate set the observer could not tell apart: the predecessors whose
//! prediction reaches the new pseudonym's first claim. The observer's posterior over Ψ
//! gives the effective set size `S = −Σ p·log₂ p` and the degree of anonymity
//! `d = S / log₂|Ψ|` of ETSI TR 103 415 §5.1.2. `d = 0` with a single candidate is the
//! honest answer — there was nobody to hide among — and `d = 1` means the observer learned
//! nothing at all.
