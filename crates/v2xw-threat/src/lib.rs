//!
//! # The firewall
//!
//! Three invariants govern this crate, and each is enforced by a *type* rather than by a
//! convention, because the failure mode they prevent is silent:
//!
//! * **I-T1** — an attacker receives no world and no actor index. [`attack::AttackerView`]
//!   has neither, and no [`v2xw_core::ids::ActorId`] either.
//! * **I-T2** — detectors and the authority pipeline run on belief only. Every input to
//!   [`detect::Detector::on_message`] is an [`obs::ObservedMessage`], the node's own
//!   [`obs::SelfBelief`] and the node's own map store.
//! * **I-T3** — every action that changes bytes on the air is logged on a ground-truth
//!   channel with the true actor id. [`attack::log_actions`] writes it, and it is **host
//!   side**: it takes the actor id as an argument precisely because nothing in the
//!   attacker can supply one.
//!
//! A detector that reads ground truth does not crash, does not look wrong and does not
//! fail a test. It simply reports a detection rate that no real receiver could achieve,
//! and nobody reports a result that is too good. So the defence is the argument type, and
//! [`ctx::ThreatCtx`] exists because [`v2xw_core::ctx::Ctx`] would have carried `world()`
//! into every signature here.
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! `v2xw-node`'s `VerifiedMessage` and `NeighborTable` and `v2xw-engine`'s scenario types
//! are not named anywhere in this crate. The belief shapes in [`obs`] mirror them field
//! for field, and the engine supplies them through a `From` adapter on its side of the
//! seam.
//!
//! ## What the engine has to call
//!
//! `tests/common/sim.rs` is a **running** attack-in-the-loop simulation built on the same
//! models `v2xw_engine::wiring` selects — the procedural world, `NativeMobility`,
//! `GaussMarkovGnss`, `LogDistanceShadowing` + `NakagamiFading`, the `PerModel`, and
//! `ObuRuntime` on the reference profile — so the two calls the engine's own loop is
//! missing are exercised rather than described. They are:
//!
//! 1. **Between `ObuRuntime::step` and the frame going on the air.** The engine's
//!    `run::Engine::launch` already takes the node's belief and turns it into a frame's
//!    `claimed_pos`/`claimed_speed_mps`/`claimed_heading_rad`. An attacker is
//!    [`attack::Attacker::act`] called on an [`attack::Emission`] built from that belief,
//!    immediately before the frame is constructed; the returned actions go to
//!    [`attack::log_actions`] with the `ActorId` the engine knows and the attacker does
//!    not. The emission's `repetitions`, `signature_valid`, `cert_valid_from/to`,
//!    `station_type`, `suppressed` and `ghosts` are what the frame must then carry, and
//!    `ghosts` are extra frames signed with the attacker's other pseudonyms.
//! 2. **On each node's delivered messages.** [`detect::Detector::on_message`] takes an
//!    [`obs::ObservedMessage`], the node's own [`obs::SelfBelief`] and the node's map
//!    store, and writes its own `det.observation` records. Four of
//!    `v2xw_node::VerifiedMessage`'s fields are not on it — the repetition count, the
//!    certificate validity window, the declared station type and the broadcast position
//!    confidence — so the frame has to carry them alongside; the harness joins them back
//!    by `(signer, generation time)`.
//!
//! Two things the harness found that the engine will meet as soon as it makes those calls
//! are recorded where they belong: [`detect`]'s module documentation, under "Measured
//! against the legacy engine".
//!
//! ## The four calls the Phase 4 models add
//!
//! The same shape: the model decides, the host applies and pays.
//!
//! 3. **On a frame the node captured, and on the energy it emits.**
//!    [`attack_ext::ExtendedAttacker`] fills three more fields of the emission the host
//!    must honour: `payload_bytes` (the oversized flood), `cert_region` (region misuse)
//!    and `perceived` (a phantom CPM), plus `raw_energy` — a jam burst the radio has to
//!    enter into its interference sums — and a ghost with `replayed` set, which the host
//!    puts on the air **verbatim** rather than re-signing, because that is what makes a
//!    relayed frame verify.
//! 4. **On a report crossing a road-side unit.** [`attack_rsu::CompromisedRsu::on_forward`]
//!    returns [`attack_rsu::ForwardDecision`] for each report handed to it: forward, drop,
//!    or forward this other one instead.
//! 5. **After an attacker acts.** [`poison::ReportPoisoner::take_reports`] hands over the
//!    reports it filed, for the host to submit through the reporting transport with that
//!    transport's delay and byte cost.
//! 6. **On each reception, at an observer node.**
//!    [`privacy::PrivacyObserver::on_message`] takes the same arguments a detector's does,
//!    plus [`privacy::PrivacyObserver::sweep`] on a timer and
//!    [`privacy::PrivacyObserver::finish`] at the end of the run, which is what closes the
//!    last tracking-duration samples.
//!
//! Two of those need something the run declares from the ground-truth side, and neither
//! model may infer it: [`resolve::TwoAuthorityResolution::declare_linkage`] (which
//! authority can resolve which pseudonym) and the digest-to-actor map the metrics crate
//! already takes through `DetectionProvider::declare_subject`, which is what turns a
//! [`records::PrivacyLinkClaim`] into a linkability rate.
//!
//! # Conformance
//!
//! The legacy renderings and thresholds are reproduced exactly, because the legacy corpus
//! was generated with them (07-threats §2.1, §3.1). `tests/legacy_conformance.rs` asserts
//! every ported constant against a value **read out of the legacy source at test time**,
//! not against a number somebody remembered — so a silent drift in either direction fails
//! the build rather than the dataset.
//!
