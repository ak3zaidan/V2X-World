//! Revocation end to end, with the latency of every stage.
//!
//! One misbehaviour report becomes a vehicle that cannot sign, across five organisations
//! and four flows, and the decomposition of how long that took is a Phase 2 acceptance
//! criterion (05-protocols.md §8, 08-measurement-and-data.md §2.9). These tests walk the
//! whole path and assert on the decomposition rather than on the outcome, because "the
//! vehicle was revoked eventually" is not the measurement.
//!
//! Both distribution paths are exercised: the cellular uplink from the CRL Store, and the
//! 5.9 GHz broadcast from the roadside. They differ in exactly one modelled thing — the
//! link — which is what makes "how long until an RSU-only vehicle enforces it" a separate
//! number from "how long until a connected one does", and
//! [`the_two_distribution_paths_are_reported_separately`] prints both.
