//! Backend service models: the reason provisioning costs something.
//!
//! 06-node-models §4 says it plainly — "nothing in a backend entity is instantaneous". An
//! entity here is a `c`-server queue: a request occupies one server for a service time
//! composed from the cryptographic operations it performs plus a fixed per-request
//! overhead, and a request that arrives while every server is busy waits. That is the
//! `medium` tier's structure with a deterministic service time; the `high` tier's
//! log-normal per-request distribution and its availability model are a documented hook
//! (`ServiceModelSpec::availability`), not built, because their parameters are
//! `todo-calibrate` in the design and inventing them would be worse than leaving the seam.
//!
//! Determinism: no RNG, no float. Service times are sums of the integer nanosecond
//! durations of `v2xw_sec::primitive`'s cost tables, and the server a request lands on is
//! the lowest-indexed one that is free earliest, chosen by an explicit total order.
