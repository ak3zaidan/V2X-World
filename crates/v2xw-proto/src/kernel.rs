//! The deterministic event kernel the flows run on.
//!
//! A protocol plug-in in the finished engine returns `Action`s and the engine routes them
//! (03-interfaces §7). The engine's loop is being built in `v2xw-engine` and its event
//! payload type does not exist yet, so this crate carries the smallest kernel that makes
//! the same guarantees — every message crosses a link with bytes (I-P1) and every compute
//! step is charged to a queue (I-P2) — and the engine adopts the entities unchanged by
//! implementing the same dispatch over its own scheduler. [`Outbox`] is the accumulator
//! form of §7's `Action` list: [`Outbox::send`] is `Send`, [`Outbox::compute`] is
//! `Compute`, [`Outbox::start_timer`] is `StartTimer`, [`Outbox::stage`] is `Emit`.
//!
//! **Determinism.** Events are ordered by `(time, sequence number)`, the sequence number
//! being the order in which events were created. That is a total order, so no two runs of
//! the same scenario can dispatch in different orders. No wall clock is read anywhere; no
//! `HashMap` is iterated anywhere; every service time is an integer number of nanoseconds.
