//! Flow identifiers, stage identifiers and the stage log.
//!
//! 05-protocols.md §8 fixes a stage vocabulary so that "revocation latency by stage" is
//! computed identically for every protocol: a run holds stamped stages, and the
//! decomposition is differences between them. This module is that vocabulary, plus the
//! stages the §3.2 provisioning and reporting sequences need, plus the log that records
//! them.
//!
//! **Where a stage is stamped.** An entity's stages are stamped at the instant it
//! *finishes* processing the step that produced them — the completion of its service
//! time, not the arrival of the message that triggered it. One rule, applied everywhere,
//! so a stage difference is always "work finished here, work finished there" and never a
//! mixture of arrivals and completions. Several stages from one step therefore share a
//! timestamp, which is why order is checked as non-decreasing rather than as strictly
//! increasing.
//!
//! **Channel.** Stage stamps ride `proto.revocation`, whose key fields 03-interfaces.md
//! §14 gives as `t, stage, id, size` — the shape of a stage stamp — and whose visibility
//! is `public`. The per-hop message records ride `proto.msg`.
