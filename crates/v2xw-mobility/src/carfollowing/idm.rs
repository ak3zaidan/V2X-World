//! `mobility/car-following/idm` — the Intelligent Driver Model (04-models.md §2.1).
//!
//! # The equations, as §2.1 states them
//!
//! ```text
//! a = a_max · [ 1 − (v/v0)^δ − (s*(v,Δv)/s)² ]
//! s*(v,Δv) = s0 + s1·√(v/v0) + max(0, T·v + v·Δv / (2·√(a_max·b)))   (s1 = 0 in the base model)
//! ```
//!
//! with `s` the net gap (leader rear to ego front) and `Δv = v − v_lead`. On a free road
//! the second term of `s*` never appears and the acceleration is `a_max(1 − (v/v0)^δ)`.
//!
//! ## Why the `max(0, ·)`
//!
//! §2.1 and R10 §B1 print the interaction term without it, and a reader who stops there
//! will not expect it here. It is nonetheless what the model means, for a reason that is
//! visible in the definition rather than in any one printing: `s*` is the **desired
//! minimum gap**, a distance, and the acceleration depends on it only through `(s*/s)²`.
//!
//! Three thresholds, all in ordinary traffic and all reached by a leader simply
//! accelerating away. The two forms are identical while the interaction term is
//! non-negative, that is while the leader is less than `T·2·√(a_max·b)` faster —
//! **5.0 m/s** for the [`IdmPreset::Kesting2010`] car and 4.7 m/s for its truck,
//! whatever the ego's own speed. Past `(s0 + T·v)·2·√(a_max·b)/v` — 6.4 m/s at
//! v = 5 m/s, 5.4 m/s at v = 20 m/s — `s*` is a *negative distance*, which the model has
//! no reading for. And past `(2·s0 + T·v)·2·√(a_max·b)/v` — 7.7 m/s at v = 5 m/s — the
//! square exceeds the floored one and grows without bound as the leader accelerates
//! away, so the ego brakes **harder the faster its leader goes**. At v = 5 m/s with a
//! leader 25 m ahead at 30 m/s the unfloored form returns −0.34 m/s² where a free road
//! gives +1.40: the vehicle decelerates out of a queue because the vehicle in front of
//! it is leaving.
//!
//! The frozen reference engine's port floors it, and that is checked rather than
//! remembered: `s_star = cfg.idm_min_gap + max(0.0, v_cur * cfg.idm_time_headway + v_cur *
//! dv / (2 * math.sqrt(a_max * b_dec)))` [`run.py` L2280-2281]. The physical-layer defect
//! register records that Treiber's own reference implementation writes the same floor —
//! **UNVERIFIED here**: no copy of that implementation is in this repository, so it is
//! carried as a second-hand statement and the argument above does not rest on it.
//! [`IdmParams::clamp_s_star`] is **on in every preset**. Turning it off reproduces the
//! literal printed expression, artefact included.
//!
//! # Parameter sets
//!
//! Four from §2.1's table, and one calibrated here:
//!
//! | Preset | Source |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`IdmPreset::UrbanHcm`] (**the native engine's drivers**) | car: `T` = 1.0 s (Treiber & Kesting's city set) and `a` = 1.7 m/s², calibrated so a signalised stop line discharges at the HCM's CBD saturation flow; truck: the Kesting 2010 column |
//! | [`IdmPreset::Kesting2010`] (the enum's default) | Kesting, Treiber and Helbing 2010, car and truck columns [R10 §B2] |
//! | [`IdmPreset::Treiber2000`] | Treiber, Hennecke and Helbing 2000, freeway calibration [R10 §B1] |
//! | [`IdmPreset::Kesting2007`] | the IDM set the MOBIL study used [R10 §B3] |
//! | [`IdmPreset::Legacy`] | the frozen reference engine [`run.py` L142-146, L2274-2283] |
//!
//! # The clamps
//!
//! The reference engine's port of the IDM carries four clamps that the printed equation
//! does not have, and §2.1 records each of them: the gap is floored at 0.5 m *after* the
//! leader's length is subtracted, `v0` is floored at 0.1 m/s, the interaction term of `s*`
//! is floored at zero (so `s*` never falls below `s0`), and the result is clamped to
//! `[−6.0, a_max]`.
//!
//! **All four are in force in every preset, not only in [`IdmPreset::Legacy`]** — a
//! reader who expects "the legacy clamps" to be legacy-only would be wrong about all of
//! them. Three carry the source `code (legacy)`, because they are the reference engine's
//! numbers and a parity run needs them, and because the `−6 m/s²` floor is the only
//! deceleration limit the model has until the `TODO: calibrate` plan of §2.1 settles one.
//! The fourth, [`IdmParams::clamp_s_star`], is not a legacy number at all but the model's
//! own domain — see "Why the `max(0, ·)`" above — and is sourced accordingly.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! `accel` draws no random numbers and reads no clock: it is a pure function of the view it
//! is handed. Driver heterogeneity arrives as a per-vehicle [`DriverProfile`], drawn once at
//! spawn from the actor's own [`v2xw_core::rng::RngDomain::DesiredSpeed`] stream. Every
//! transcendental goes through [`v2xw_core::math`].
