//! VRU mobility — 04-models.md §2.5.
//!
//! * [`social_force`] — `vru/pedestrian/social-force`, the medium tier: the Helbing and
//!   Molnár 1995 force model, walking the world's sidewalk and crossing lanes.
//! * [`crosswalk`] — the crosswalk rules both sides obey: a vehicle yields to a pedestrian
//!   on a crosswalk and does not stop in one; a pedestrian steps off the kerb only on walk
//!   and only when an approaching vehicle can still yield.
//!
//! `striping-sumo` is SUMO's and belongs to the high tier; §2.5 records its parameters for
//! the adapter. `vru/cyclist/lane-follow` is the IDM on a bike lane with the `bicycle`
//! class of §2.7, which is [`crate::carfollowing::idm`] plus
//! [`crate::classes::VehicleClass::Bicycle`] and needs no model of its own.
