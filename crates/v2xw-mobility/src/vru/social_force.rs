//! `vru/pedestrian/social-force` — Helbing and Molnár 1995 (04-models.md §2.5).
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! ```text
//! dv_α/dt = (v0_α·e_α − v_α)/τ  +  Σ_β f_αβ  +  Σ_B f_αB  +  fluctuations
//! f_αβ = −∇_r V_αβ(b),   V_αβ(b) = V0·exp(−b/σ)
//! f_αB = −∇   U_αB(d),   U_αB(d) = U0·exp(−d/R)
//! b    = ½·√( (|r| + |r − y|)² − |y|² ),   y = v_β·Δt·e_β
//! ```
//!
//! `b` is the semi-minor axis of an ellipse whose foci are the other pedestrian's present
//! and next positions: the repulsion is *directed*, because a pedestrian steps out of the
//! way of where the other one is **going**. Its gradient has a closed form,
//! `∇_r b = ((|r| + |r − y|) / (4b))·(r̂ + (r − y)ˆ)`, which is what this module evaluates.
//!
//! **Status of the gradient:** R10 §B11 records the parameter table and the *form* of the
//! model (`dw/dt = F + fluctuations`, with a desired-direction term, pairwise repulsion,
//! border repulsion and optional attraction), not this reduction. The closed form above is
//! the standard one and is transcribed rather than quoted, so it is flagged on the card.
//! [`SocialForceParams::elliptical`] turns it off, which falls back to the isotropic
//! `b = |r|` that needs no reduction at all.
//!
//! # The parameters, all from §2.5
//!
//! | Parameter | Default |
//! |---|---|
//! | desired speed mean, std | 1.34, 0.26 m/s (Gaussian) |
//! | maximum speed | 1.3 × v0 |
//! | relaxation time τ | 0.5 s |
//! | pedestrian-pedestrian `V0`, `σ` | 2.1 m²/s², 0.3 m |
//! | pedestrian-border `U0`, `R` | 10 m²/s², 0.2 m |
//! | step width Δt (elliptical potential) | 2 s |
//! | field of view 2φ | 200° |
//! | behind-view weight c | 0.5 |
//! | vehicle blocking threshold | 10 m (`jmCrossingGap`, R10 §B13) |
//!
//! The fluctuation term has **no cited magnitude** — the paper says "fluctuations" — so its
//! default is zero and it carries a `TODO: calibrate` plan. A pedestrian model with an
//! invented noise term would look more realistic and be less true.
//!
//! # Staying on the pavement
//!
//! The border potential is soft: with a finite step a pedestrian *could* cross a kerb, and
//! at `U0 = 10 m²/s²` and `R = 0.2 m` the force only becomes large within a few
//! decimetres. So the model also **clamps** the lateral offset to the walkable half-width
//! at the end of every step. The clamp is a hard constraint on top of a soft potential,
//! recorded on the card: without it the published invariant "pedestrians walk on sidewalk
//! lanes and crossings" would hold only statistically, and the crate's own test asserts it
//! absolutely.
