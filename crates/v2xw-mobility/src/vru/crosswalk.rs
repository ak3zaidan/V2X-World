//! Crosswalks as the traffic model sees them: when a vehicle yields, and when a pedestrian
//! may step off the kerb.
//!
//! Both sides read one function, [`CrosswalkIndex::ahead`], which walks a vehicle's own
//! route and returns every crosswalk band on it with the distance to its near and far
//! edges. So "the vehicle can still stop" (the pedestrian's test) and "the vehicle must
//! stop" (the driver's) are measured on the same geometry and cannot disagree.
//!
//! # The rules and their sources
//!
//! | Rule | Source |
//! |---|---|
//! | A driver yields to a pedestrian in a crosswalk at an uncontrolled crossing — here the whole crosswalk, not only the driver's half | UVC §11-502(a) (the half-roadway form; many states, New York among them for a marked crosswalk, extend it) |
//! | A driver turning on a green yields to pedestrians lawfully in an adjacent crosswalk | UVC §11-202(a)1; NY VTL §1111(a)1 |
//! | A pedestrian does not leave the kerb into the path of a vehicle so close that it cannot yield | UVC §11-502(b) |
//! | A pedestrian starts to cross only on the WALKING PERSON indication; on flashing or steady UPRAISED HAND they do not start | UVC §11-203; MUTCD 2009 §4E.02 |
//! | A driver does not stop within a crosswalk | UVC §11-1003(a)1(e); NY VTL §1202(a)1(e) |
//! | The stop point is 4 ft (1.2 m) before the crosswalk | MUTCD 2009 §3B.16: a stop line "should be placed a minimum of 4 feet in advance of the nearest crosswalk line" |
//!
//! "Cannot yield" is judged with the deceleration most drivers brake at for something
//! unexpected, 3.4 m/s² (AASHTO *Green Book* 2018 §3.2.2, the engine's planned-stop limit)
//! after a reaction of [`PEDESTRIAN_REACTION_MARGIN_S`]. That reaction is **this crate's
//! choice, not a cited value**: the vehicle model reacts within one step, and the margin
//! makes a pedestrian wait for a vehicle that could stop only by braking the instant the
//! pedestrian moved.
