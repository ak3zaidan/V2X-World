//! The plug-in traits of 03-interfaces.md §3.
//!
//! Every one extends [`Model`], so a registered mobility model always carries a card
//! (03-interfaces.md §12) and the card is reachable from the live object.
//!
//! # Deviations from the document, and why
//!
//! Three signatures differ from the ones 03-interfaces.md prints, and each difference is a
//! compile error in the document's version:
//!
//! 1. `&mut dyn Ctx` becomes `&mut dyn MobCtx`. [`v2xw_core::ctx::Ctx`] has an associated
//!    `Payload` type that only the kernel crate can name; [`crate::ctx`] explains the
//!    adapter and the one-line migration.
//! 2. `Mobility::init` takes `Box<dyn Demand>`, not `&dyn Demand`. Two things make the
//!    document's version impossible: [`Demand::spawns_in`] takes `&mut self`, because a
//!    demand model advances a stream, so a shared reference cannot call it at all; and
//!    `step` — which is where trips actually arrive — is given no demand argument, so the
//!    mobility model must *hold* the demand model rather than borrow it for the length of
//!    one call. Taking ownership at `init` is the only reading of the two signatures
//!    together that compiles. The separate `world: &World` parameter is dropped as well:
//!    the world is [`MobCtx::world`], and passing it twice would let a caller pass two
//!    different worlds.
//! 3. `Mobility::step` takes `dt: Duration`, not `dt: SimTime`. [`SimTime`] is an instant
//!    and [`Duration`] is a length of time; the step length is the second thing.
//!
//! One method is *added* rather than changed: [`CarFollowing::profile`]. 03-interfaces.md
//! §3 gives the trait `accel` alone, which leaves the engine with no way to ask a
//! car-following model for the per-class driver parameters that model was calibrated with;
//! the engine used a hard-coded set instead, so `NativeMobility::legacy()` ran the legacy
//! equations with Kesting 2010 drivers. It is defaulted, so no implementation outside this
//! crate has to change.
