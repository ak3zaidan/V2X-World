//! The value types the mobility traits of 03-interfaces.md §3 exchange.
//!
//! 03-interfaces.md names these types in the trait signatures but does not define them, so
//! they are defined here, once, and every model in the crate speaks them. Three rules shape
//! them:
//!
//! 1. **A view is a copy of a snapshot, not a borrow of live state.** Every view here is
//!    built from the start-of-step [`crate::snapshot::ActorSnapshot`], so a model cannot
//!    observe another actor's mid-step state and the update is the Jacobi update ADR 0004
//!    requires.
//! 2. **A view carries the per-vehicle parameters a neighbour's behaviour depends on**
//!    ([`DriverProfile`]), because MOBIL has to score the acceleration *another* vehicle
//!    would experience, and scoring it with the ego's parameters would be wrong.
//! 3. **Distances are net gaps in metres along the route**, leader rear to follower front,
//!    with the leader's length already subtracted. Every model in the crate reads `gap_m`
//!    with that one meaning.
