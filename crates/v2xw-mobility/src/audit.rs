//! The traffic-invariant auditor: every vehicle, every step, against the rules a road
//! user is held to.
//!
//! # Why it exists
//!
//! The owner watched the live page and reported cars that touch, cars that go through
//! buildings, a car that drives round a queue stopped at a red light and through the
//! junction, and motion that is not smooth. Each of those is an *invariant* a traffic
//! model must hold at every step, and none of them was checked anywhere: the engine's unit
//! tests put two or three vehicles on a lane and look at one property each. This module
//! checks all of them, for every vehicle, at every mobility step, on whatever scenario it
//! is handed, and counts every violation by class with examples (vehicle, time, place).
//!
//! # What it reads
//!
//! [`crate::NativeMobility::audit_actors`] — the engine's own internal state (lane, front
//! arc length, lateral offset, speed, acceleration, lane-change transition, next route
//! lane) and the published pose — and the world, including the signal plans. The signal
//! state a vehicle is judged against is the engine's own: the plan evaluated at the
//! instant the step's decisions were taken (`t0`), which is exactly what
//! [`crate::intersection::FixedTimeSignals::state_for`] reads.
//!
//! # The checks
//!
//! | Class | The rule |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`Check::Overlap`] | two vehicles' oriented footprints intersect |
//! | [`Check::GapBelowMinimum`] | a follower's net gap to its in-path leader is below its own standstill gap `s0` |
//! | [`Check::LateralOffset`] | the offset from the lane centreline exceeds what a lane change can produce |
//! | [`Check::InBuilding`] | a vehicle's body centre or a corner is inside a building footprint |
//! | [`Check::OutsideJunction`] | a vehicle on a junction's internal path is outside the junction area |
//! | [`Check::RedEntry`] | a vehicle entered a junction on a red (or red-amber) for its movement |
//! | [`Check::AmberEntry`] | it entered on an amber it could have stopped for, from beyond the far edge of the dilemma zone at the amber's onset |
//! | [`Check::ConflictZone`] | two vehicles on conflicting movements occupy the same conflict zone at once |
//! | [`Check::LaneChangeNearJunction`] | a lane change started inside the no-change zone before a stop line |
//! | [`Check::QueueJump`] | a lane change round a vehicle standing at the stop line, started inside the no-change zone |
//! | [`Check::IllegalTransition`] | a vehicle arrived on a lane the lane graph does not connect to its previous one |
//! | [`Check::Teleport`] | the published position moved further in one step than the speed allows |
//! | [`Check::StepSpeed`] | the published position moved a distance the reported speed does not explain — a freeze or a catch-up jump |
//! | [`Check::HeadingJump`] / [`Check::HeadingFlip`] | the heading turned faster than a car can, or reversed |
//! | [`Check::SpeedJump`] | the speed changed faster than any acceleration the vehicle can produce |
//! | [`Check::AccelBound`] | the acceleration is outside the vehicle's capability or the tyre-road limit |
//! | [`Check::Jerk`] | the acceleration changed faster than the jerk bound |
//! | [`Check::Standstill`] | a vehicle stood still for longer than the standstill limit (gridlock) |
//! | [`Check::MidRoadDespawn`] | a vehicle left the road anywhere but at the end of its trip |
//! | [`Check::PedestrianOverlap`] | a vehicle's footprint and a pedestrian's intersect |
//! | [`Check::OccupiedCrosswalkEntry`] | a vehicle's front crossed into a crosswalk band while someone was on that crosswalk |
//! | [`Check::PedestrianDontWalkEntry`] | a pedestrian stepped onto a signalised crosswalk that was not showing walk |
//!
//! And three static checks of the world ([`audit_world`]): internal paths that leave their
//! junction, lanes that pass through a building, and signal phases that give two
//! conflicting movements a protected green at once.
//!
//! # The bounds, and where they come from
//!
//! See [`AuditParams`]: every bound is stated with its source or marked as this crate's
//! choice. None of them is tuned to make a run pass — the tests in this module inject each
//! fault and watch the check go red.
