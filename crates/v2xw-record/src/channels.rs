//! The channel catalogue — 03-interfaces.md §14 and `vwp-v1.md` §3.6.2.
//!
//! One table, three consumers: the recorder (which MCAP topic, which schema, which
//! metadata), the `NODE-only` profile (which channels are ground truth and must be
//! stripped whole), and the exporters (which tables to write). Keeping it in one place is
//! what stops the three drifting apart, which is the failure mode ADR 0008's "one schema
//! set" consequence was written against.
//!
//! # Two topic namespaces, deliberately
//!
//! Build decision D11 item 5 fixes two encodings and says not to unify them, and this
//! table is where that shows up:
//!
//! * `vwp/…` topics carry **VWP v1 frames verbatim**, header included, message encoding
//!   `vwp1` (§7.1). `snapshot.keyframe` and `snapshot.delta` live here and nowhere else:
//!   storing the bytes that went over the wire is what makes live and replay provably
//!   identical (§7.2), and a re-encode would destroy the guarantee.
//! * `record/…` topics carry **serde `Record` JSON**, message encoding `json`, one topic
//!   per event, telemetry and metric family. These are the rows Parquet, Arrow IPC and
//!   JSONL are written from.
//!
//! The wire specification's §7.1 mapping table describes only the first namespace,
//! because it is describing a UI stream; D11 item 5 adds the second, because a dataset
//! wants a self-describing columnar row and not a packed C struct. A recording may carry
//! either or both, and the recorder refuses to mix them on one topic.
