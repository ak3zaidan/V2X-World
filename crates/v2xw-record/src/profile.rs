//! Visibility profiles and the `NODE-only` transformation — §5, and ADR 0008's
//! "ground-truth channels are tagged; a `NODE-only` replay profile strips them for blind
//! demonstrations".
//!
//! # What blind means here
//!
//! §5.2's exact ground-truth set is implemented field by field below. The principled rule
//! is the one §5.2 states: an unequipped actor transmits nothing, so no node-visible
//! source can know it exists, and its slot is left empty; an equipped actor keeps its
//! pose, because its own broadcasts assert exactly that. The profile strips labels,
//! identity linkage and the truth of a claim. It is not an occlusion simulator.
//!
//! # One blanking implementation, two callers
//!
//! The same functions serve the producer and the stripper, which is what makes
//! conformance V5 (a `full` recording replayed as `node` is byte-identical to a live
//! `node` run) reachable rather than aspirational: there is only one way to blank a
//! frame, so both paths produce the same bytes.
//!
//! # The two callers blank at different moments, and the stripper has to make up for it
//!
//! They are not symmetric, and the asymmetry was a leak. The live producer blanks its
//! *input* ([`crate::encoder::SnapshotEncoder::encode`] calls `blank_input` first), so the
//! lane and `ST_ATTACKER` are already gone when §3.4.2's "only actors whose quantised
//! pose, `state`, `verified_neighbors` or lane changed appear" decides whether to emit a
//! moved row. The stripper blanks a row that the *full* producer already decided to emit.
//!
//! So a parked actor that changes lane, or whose attacker bit toggles, gets a moved row in
//! the full stream; blanking it leaves `dx=dy=dz=0`, `mflags=0` and every other field
//! equal to the previous one, and a live `node` run emits no row at all. The stripped
//! stream is then not byte-identical to a live one (V5 fails), and worse, the surviving
//! all-zero row carries no information *except* "a §5.2 ground-truth field changed at this
//! step" — which is exactly what the profile exists to withhold, so it weakens V1 as well.
//! A blind demonstration would leak through the pattern of emitted rows.
//!
//! [`NodeProfileStripper`] therefore keeps the blanked `(state, verified_neighbors)` it
//! last transmitted per slot and drops a blanked moved row that is a no-op against it.
//! That is §3.4.2's own predicate, evaluated on blanked values, which is precisely what
//! the live producer evaluates. Heading, speed and acceleration deliberately do not enter
//! it: they ride along on a row and never trigger one, in either producer.
//!
//! # The stripper is stateful, and has to be
//!
//! A despawn row carries a slot and a cause, nothing else — so whether it belongs in a
//! blanked stream depends on whether the slot was ever occupied *in that stream*. A live
//! `node` run never allocates a slot for an unequipped actor, so its deltas have no such
//! despawn. [`NodeProfileStripper`] therefore tracks occupancy as it walks the recording
//! and drops rows for slots it did not keep.
//!
//! # It renumbers `seq`, and that is the right call
//!
//! A batch that was entirely ground truth is withheld whole, so a blind stream has fewer
//! canonical frames than the stream it came from. §1.4 requires `seq` to be dense and
//! assigned "by the *producer* … in canonical emission order", and under `profile=node`
//! the replay reader *is* that producer, so the stripper renumbers from zero rather than
//! leaving gaps. Two consequences, both wanted: the blind stream satisfies conformance H4
//! like any other, and its frames come out identical to a live `node` run's (V5), which
//! they could not if one stream had gaps the other did not. Nothing is lost by
//! renumbering, because the profile is fixed for the life of a connection (§5.3), so no
//! client ever holds a `seq` from one profile and resumes into the other.
