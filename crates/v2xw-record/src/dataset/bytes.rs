//! Byte provenance: which of a dataset's byte counts came from real bytes and which from
//! a size model.
//!
//! 08-measurement-and-data.md §6 asks a datasheet to say what produced its numbers. For
//! every number *except* the byte counts, the model card answers that. The byte counts are
//! different, and the difference is the one that decides whether a result can be cited:
//!
//! * a **UPER** or **COER** encoding produces the octets that would have gone over the
//!   air. `bytes_on_wire` is then a measurement of an encoding, and an envelope-overhead
//!   ratio computed from it is a result about IEEE 1609.2, reproducible by anyone with the
//!   same ASN.1 module;
//! * the **validated size model** of 04-models.md §8.4 produces a *length* and fills the
//!   payload with `0xA5`. `bytes_on_wire` is then a prediction of a model whose own
//!   tolerance is stated on its card, and an overhead ratio computed from it is a result
//!   about that model.
//!
//! Both are legitimate and the engine ships both: the SAE J2735 ASN.1 module cannot be
//! redistributed (risk R1, 11-open-questions), so PSM, SRM and SSM are modelled and the
//! ETSI messages are real. What is *not* legitimate is a table of overhead figures that
//! does not say which rows are which — and the failure mode is quiet, because a modelled
//! size and a real one are the same kind of integer and land in the same column.
//!
//! # Why the engine declares this and the exporter does not infer it
//!
//! `v2xw-record` does not depend on `v2xw-msg` and must not: the exporter's job is to read
//! recorded channels, and a dependency on the encoder would let it recompute what the run
//! did rather than report it. So [`ByteProvenance`] is *declared* per message type in
//! [`super::RunProvenance::message_encodings`], by the layer that chose the codec, and
//! this module joins that declaration against what the recording actually carries.
//!
//! The join is the check. A message type that appears in `node.tx` and is missing from the
//! declaration is reported as [`ByteProvenance::Undeclared`] and its bytes are counted as
//! neither real nor modelled, so a dataset cannot acquire citable byte counts by the
//! engine forgetting to declare a codec. A declaration that matches no traffic is reported
//! too ([`ByteProvenanceReport::declared_types_unused`]), because a stale declaration is
//! how this section would come to describe the wrong run.
//!
//! # No floats
//!
//! Every quantity here is an integer count of bytes or messages, and the one derived
//! figure — the real share — is carried in **parts per thousand** as a `u64`. That is not
//! fussiness: build decision D9 requires every exported float to sit on a declared grid,
//! and the honest way to satisfy it for a ratio nobody needs to three decimal places is
//! not to write a float at all.
