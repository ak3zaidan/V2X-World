//! Synthetic recordings for tests, benchmarks and the conformance kit.
//!
//! A recording container is hard to test without a run to record, and the engine that
//! produces one lives above this crate. This module is the substitute: a deterministic
//! synthetic run with no randomness in it at all, so two builds of it agree byte for
//! byte, which is exactly the property the tests are about.
//!
//! It is public because `v2xw-server`'s replay tests and the conformance kit need the
//! same fixture, and a second copy of it would drift from this one.
//!
//! # Deterministic by construction
//!
//! The trajectories are closed-form functions of the step index through
//! [`v2xw_core::math`], never the platform libm and never an RNG: a fixture that differed
//! between macOS and Linux would make every byte-identity test a coin toss.
