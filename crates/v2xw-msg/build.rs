//! Build script: generate Rust ASN.1 bindings from the ETSI forge modules.
//!
//! Build decision D2 fixes the encoder strategy: the ETSI facilities layer and the
//! IEEE 1609.2 / TS 103 097 security envelope are **really encoded**, from bindings this
//! script generates with `rasn-compiler`; SAE J2735 is not, because `rasn-compiler`
//! cannot compile its `RegionalExtension` information-object-class idiom.
//!
//! Two independent generation units are produced into `OUT_DIR`:
//!
//! | Unit | File | ASN.1 modules | Encoding |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | facilities | `etsi_facilities.rs` | `ETSI-ITS-CDD` (TS 102 894-2 R2), `CAM-PDU-Descriptions` (TS 103 900 R2), `DENM-PDU-Description` (TS 103 831 R2) | UPER |
//! | security | `sec_types.rs` | `Ieee1609Dot2BaseTypes`, `Ieee1609Dot2`, `Ieee1609Dot2CrlBaseTypes`, `Ieee1609Dot2Crl`, `EtsiTs103097Module`, `EtsiTs103097ExtensionModule` | COER |
//!
//! They are separate because they are consumed separately: `v2xw-sec` needs the second
//! and nothing of the first, and the CDD (370 KB of ASN.1, ~10 k lines of Rust) has no
//! business being recompiled inside the security crate.
//!
//! # Hermetic and offline
//!
//! Every input is a file inside this repository, under `third_party/asn1/etsi/`. The
//! script opens no socket, spawns no process and reads no environment variable other
//! than the ones Cargo sets. If an input is missing the script says which file and where
//! it should have come from, rather than failing inside the compiler.
//!
//! # Encoding hygiene (D4)
//!
//! Three upstream modules (`ETSI-ITS-CDD`, `Ieee1609Dot2`, `Ieee1609Dot2BaseTypes`) are
//! CP1252, not UTF-8, and `rasn-compiler` aborts on them with "stream did not contain
//! valid UTF-8". The byte-exact originals are kept for provenance; this script reads the
//! `normalized-utf8/` copies, which differ only in comment characters. See
//! `third_party/asn1/etsi/PROVENANCE.md` for both hashes of each.
//!
//! # Patches (D5)
//!
//! `rasn-compiler` 0.16 has a known codegen defect in `DEFAULT` values of fixed-size
//! BIT STRINGs, which hits `Ieee1609Dot2`. It is carried as a recorded patch file in
//! `patches/`, applied to the generated text, and the build fails if a patch no longer
//! applies — so an upstream fix is noticed rather than silently ignored.
