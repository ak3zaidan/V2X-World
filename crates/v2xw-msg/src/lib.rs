//! `v2xw-msg` — the message layer: what a node sends, when, and what it weighs on the wire.
//!
//! # Read this first: the bytes are not all real
//!
//! Build decision D2 divides the message set into tiers, and the whole crate is organised
//! around that division. Anything that consumes an encoded message must branch on
//! [`codec::Encoded::size_source`] before it treats the payload as data, because the
//! bottom tier produces no payload at all — and anything that *reports* a size must go one
//! step further and consult [`evidence`], because two tiers share one `size_source` and
//! only one of them has been checked against an independent implementation.
//!
//! | Tier | Messages | What [`codec::Encoded::bytes`] contains | `size_source` |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | **Real ASN.1, generated** | ETSI CAM, DENM, VAM ([`vam`]) (this crate); IEEE 1609.2 / TS 103 097 envelope and certificates (`v2xw-sec`, over [`sec_types`]) | the wire bytes, from `rasn` bindings generated at build time from the ETSI forge modules | [`codec::SizeSource::Uper`] / [`codec::SizeSource::Coer`] |
//! | **Hand-written, oracle-validated** | SAE J2735 BSM ([`j2735::bsm`]) | the wire bytes of the subset the simulator fills | [`codec::SizeSource::Uper`] |
//! | **Hand-written, not yet validated** | SAE J2735 SPaT ([`j2735::spat`]), MAP ([`j2735::map`]) and PSM ([`j2735::psm`]) | the wire bytes of the subset the simulator fills | [`codec::SizeSource::Uper`] |
//! | **Size model** | J2735 PSM, SRM, SSM ([`size_model`]); ETSI CPM, VAM ([`etsi_size`]) — the PSM and VAM rows are what the generic codec seam (and [`evidence`]) still register; the VRU device sends the real [`j2735::psm`] and [`vam`] bytes | **a fill pattern of exactly the modelled length** | [`codec::SizeSource::SizeModel`] |
//!
//! [`evidence`] is the machine-readable form of that table — one row per
//! [`codec::MsgType`], and the paragraph every model card's `limitations` starts with. A
//! number is only "byte-exact" if [`evidence::ByteExactness::is_byte_exact`] says so:
//! [`codec::SizeSource`] cannot tell you, because the second and third tiers share one
//! value and carry very different evidence.
//!
//! ## Why the middle and bottom tiers exist
//!
//! Not for want of trying. `rasn-compiler` 0.16 *does* generate Rust for all 43 SAE J2735
//! 2024-09 modules — and that Rust does not compile: 170 errors, essentially all from
//! `RegionalExtension {REG-EXT-ID-AND-TYPE : Set}`, a parameterised type over an information
//! object class that the compiler does not implement. Mechanically deleting the 55 optional
//! `regional` fields makes codegen succeed and still leaves 105 errors, so it is not a
//! one-line fix. On top of that, the J2735 ASN.1 carries an SAE licence forbidding
//! redistribution, so the modules are git-ignored and can never be committed (build
//! decision D3).
//!
//! The ETSI forge modules have neither problem: they are BSD-3-Clause, they are committed
//! under `third_party/asn1/etsi/` with their licences and a provenance record, and the Rust
//! generated from them compiles and round-trips. So the ETSI stack is genuinely encoded and
//! the US stack is not — and this crate never pretends otherwise.
//!
//! Two gaps in that story are worth stating at the top rather than in a module nobody
//! opens, because both are about *this checkout* rather than about the design:
//!
//! * `third_party/asn1/j2735/` **does not exist here** (it is git-ignored by D3), and
//!   neither does the `pycrate` oracle environment. The BSM codec was written and
//!   validated when both were present. The SPaT and MAP codecs were not: their structure
//!   is corroborated where an artefact in this repository corroborates it and recalled
//!   where nothing does, every recalled choice is a named constant, and their card says
//!   the bytes are unvalidated.
//! * `CPM-PDU-Descriptions.asn` is **not committed**, so the CPM is sized instead
//!   ([`etsi_size`], which lists the steps that fix it). `VAM-PDU-Descriptions.asn` was
//!   committed on 2026-09-23 and the VAM is generated ([`vam`]).

//!   [`v2xw_core::rng::RngStream`].
//! * No `HashMap` iteration reaches an output: [`denm::DenmService::poll`] sorts by
