//! Building, encoding and decoding a real ETSI DENM, with the EN 302 637-3 lifecycle.
//!
//! The message is ETSI TS 103 831 (DENM, Release 2) over ETSI TS 102 894-2 Release 2. A
//! DENM is not a periodic broadcast like a CAM: it announces an *event*, lives for a
//! declared validity, may be repeated for as long as the application says, and ends by
//! being cancelled by its originator or negated by someone else. This module holds both
//! halves — the encoder and the lifecycle — because the lifecycle is what decides which
//! fields the encoder has to fill.
//!
//! # The rules, from 04-models.md §8.1 and EN 302 637-3 V1.3.1
//!
//! | Rule | Clause | Where |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | A new DENM gets an unused `actionId` | §8.2.1.5 | [`ActionIdAllocator`] |
//! | An update keeps the `actionId` and advances `referenceTime` | §6.1.2 | [`DenmService::update`] |
//! | Repetition happens only if the application supplies `repetitionInterval` **and** `repetitionDuration`; neither is carried in the message | §6.1.4.2 | [`Repetition`] |
//! | `T_Repetition = repetitionInterval`, bounded by `validityDuration` | §6.1.4.2 | [`DenmService::poll`] |
//! | Default validity is 600 s from `detectionTime` | ASN.1 `defaultValidity INTEGER ::= 600` | [`DEFAULT_VALIDITY`] |
//! | Termination is a cancellation (originator) or a negation (other ITS-S), transmitted at least once | §8.3.2.5 | [`DenmService::cancel`], [`DenmService::negate`] |
//! | Keep-alive forwarding at `2 × transmissionInterval + U(0, 150 ms)`, capped at validity | Annex B | [`forwarding_delay`] |
//!
//! # The one structural constraint the generated code cannot express
//!
//! `DenmPayload`'s ASN.1 carries an inner-subtyping constraint:
//!
//! ```asn1
//! ((WITH COMPONENTS {..., management (WITH COMPONENTS {..., termination ABSENT}),
//!                         situation PRESENT, location PRESENT}) |
//!  (WITH COMPONENTS {..., management (WITH COMPONENTS {..., termination PRESENT}),
//!                         situation ABSENT, location ABSENT, alacarte ABSENT}))
//! ```
//!
//! — an ordinary DENM must carry a situation and a location container, and a terminating
//! one must carry neither. `rasn-compiler` does not carry `WITH COMPONENTS` inner subtyping
//! into the generated types (the same gap that stops ETSI TS 102 941 compiling, build
//! decision D5), so the constraint is enforced here instead: [`build_denm`] fills both
//! containers and [`build_termination_denm`] fills neither, and
//! [`tests::a_termination_denm_carries_no_situation_or_location`] pins it.
