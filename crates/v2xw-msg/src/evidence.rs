//! Which messages are byte-exact, which are only structurally real, and which are sized —
//! one table, in code, that every model card is generated from.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Build decision D2 divided the message set into real encoders and a size model, and the
//! crate documentation has said so in prose since. Prose drifts. A researcher quoting an
//! overhead figure needs to know, without reading three module headers, whether the number
//! came from bytes an independent implementation agreed with, from bytes a generator
//! produced from the published module, from bytes this crate wrote but nobody has checked,
//! or from a table. Those are four different claims and this is the one place that states
//! them.
//!
//! [`EVIDENCE`] has exactly one row per [`MsgType`], a test enforces that, and every
//! codec's card takes its byte-exactness paragraph from [`card_statement`] rather than
//! writing its own. So a message cannot be described as byte-exact in a card while this
//! table calls it modelled: the card is the table.
//!
//! # The levels, and the line between them
//!
//! | Level | What the bytes are | What has checked them | Byte-exact? |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`ByteExactness::OracleValidated`] | the wire bytes | an independent implementation of the same ASN.1 agreed, byte for byte, on recorded vectors | yes |
//! | [`ByteExactness::GeneratedFromModule`] | the wire bytes | nothing third-party, but the encoder was machine-generated from the specification's own committed ASN.1, so there is no human reading of a constraint to get wrong | yes |
//! | [`ByteExactness::RealUperUnvalidated`] | the wire bytes of a documented subset | this crate's own round-trip and size tests, and nothing else | **no** |
//! | [`ByteExactness::SizeModelled`] | **a fill pattern** of the modelled length | published anchors, where any exist | **no** |
//! | [`ByteExactness::NotEncoded`] | there are none | — | — |
//!
//! The line that matters runs under the second row. Above it the bytes are the standard's:
//! either a generator produced them from the published module or an independent
//! implementation agreed with them. Below it they are this crate's, and a consistent
//! misreading of a constraint would round-trip perfectly and still be wrong on the wire.
//! That is not a hypothetical — the standing example is the asymmetric `Longitude` lower
//! bound, which passed 122 of this crate's unit tests and failed 235 of 235 oracle
//! vectors.
//!
//! [`ByteExactness::GeneratedFromModule`] is not the same claim as
//! [`ByteExactness::OracleValidated`] and is not presented as one: no ETSI conformance
//! vector has been checked, so a defect in `rasn` itself would go unnoticed.
//! [`ByteExactness::has_independent_check`] is the predicate that tells the two apart.
