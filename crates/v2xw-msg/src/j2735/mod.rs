//! SAE J2735: hand-written UPER codecs for the messages the simulator puts on the wire.
//!
//! The middle tier of build decision D2. The ETSI stack is generated from committed
//! BSD-3-Clause modules and the rest of J2735 is a size model; these messages sit between
//! them, with genuinely real bytes produced by code written against the 2024-09 ASN.1
//! rather than by a code generator that cannot compile it.
//!
//! | Module | What it holds |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`uper`] | the bit-level engine: a bit writer and reader, and one function per X.691 construct these messages need |
//! | [`bsm`] | the Basic Safety Message: `BSMcoreData` field for field, the `VehicleSafetyExtensions` Part II container, the `MessageFrame` wrapper, and the builder from a node's belief |
//! | [`spat`] | `SPAT`: intersection states, movement states, movement events and their timing |
//! | [`map`] | `MapData`: intersection geometry, lanes, node lists and connections |
//! | [`psm`] | the Personal Safety Message: the mandatory fields and `Position3D`, the `MessageFrame` wrapper, and the builder from a VRU device's belief — real UPER, oracle-validated (153 vectors) |
//! | [`infra`] | the [`crate::MessageCodec`] seam for SPaT and MAP, and the card that states how well evidenced they are |
//!
//! # Trusting the bytes — and the two codecs are not equally trustworthy
//!
//! A hand-written encoder that only ever round-trips against itself proves nothing: a
//! consistent misreading of a constraint — the asymmetric `Longitude` lower bound is the
//! standing example — round-trips perfectly and is wrong on the wire. So the evidence for
//! the BSM codec is an **oracle**: `tests/j2735_oracle.rs` generates pseudo-random but
//! valid BSMs from a fixed seed, encodes them here, and has `pycrate` (which compiles the
//! real ASN.1 at run time) decode them and compare field for field — then encode from the
//! same field values and compare bytes, and finally hand its own bytes back for this codec
//! to decode. Three directions, because each catches a different class of defect. That run
//! happened: 235 vectors, byte-identical.
//!
//! **The SPaT, MAP and PSM codecs had their run on 2026-10-06**, against `pycrate`
//! compiled from the public J2735 2016 and 2020 modules (the 2024-09 modules the codecs
//! are written to are not public): 115 SPaT, 112 MAP and 153 PSM vectors byte-identical
//! in every direction. The one 2024 difference in the fields they fill, `TimeMark`'s
//! range, is spelled out in `tests/j2735_infra_oracle.rs`.
//!
//! The BSM oracle skips the same way when its environment is absent, which is how it
//! behaves in CI; it is not skipped when the environment is present, and the codec's model
//! card records the pass count from the run that validated it.
//!
//! # Where the message type is claimed
//!
//! [`J2735BsmCodec`] is the [`crate::MessageCodec`] for [`crate::MsgType::Bsm`], and
//! [`crate::size_model::codecs`] includes it, so the registry's
//! [`crate::size_model::assert_no_overlapping_claims`] check covers it like any other.
//!
//! Note what the codec seam can and cannot carry. [`crate::Message`] has no structured BSM
//! variant — a BSM travels as [`crate::Message::HandEncoded`] — so [`J2735BsmCodec::encode`]
//! takes bytes and *validates* them by decoding, while [`bsm::encode_bsm`] and
//! [`bsm::build_bsm`] are the structured path a node actually uses. That is deliberate:
//! putting a 14-field wire structure into the engine-wide `Message` enum would make every
//! consumer of that enum depend on J2735's field layout.
