//! The [`crate::MessageCodec`] seam for the hand-written J2735 infrastructure messages.
//!
//! [`J2735InfraCodec`] claims [`MsgType::Spat`] and [`MsgType::Map`] and routes them to
//! [`crate::j2735::spat`] and [`crate::j2735::map`]. It is a separate codec from
//! [`crate::j2735::J2735BsmCodec`] for one reason, and it is the reason this module has a
//! long card: **the evidence behind its bytes is weaker**, and a registry entry is where a
//! run's manifest goes to find that out. Merging the two would average an oracle-validated
//! encoder together with an unvalidated one behind a single status.
//!
//! Like the BSM codec, this one carries messages as [`Message::HandEncoded`] bytes rather
//! than as a structured [`Message`] variant: putting a MAP's lane geometry into the
//! engine-wide message enum would make every consumer of that enum depend on J2735's field
//! layout. [`crate::j2735::spat::encode_spat`] and [`crate::j2735::map::encode_map`] are
//! the structured path.
