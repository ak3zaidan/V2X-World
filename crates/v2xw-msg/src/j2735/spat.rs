//! The SAE J2735 `SPAT` message: signal phase and timing, hand-encoded.
//!
//! # Why this is hand-written
//!
//! Build decision D2, for the same reason as the BSM: `rasn-compiler` cannot compile the
//! J2735 modules (170 errors from the `RegionalExtension {REG-EXT-ID-AND-TYPE : Set}`
//! parameterised type), so anything in J2735 the simulator needs on the wire is written
//! against the ASN.1 by hand over the bit engine in [`crate::j2735::uper`].
//!
//! # Read this before quoting a SPaT size: the evidence is weaker than the BSM's
//!
//! The BSM codec ships with a `pycrate` oracle that compiled the real ASN.1 and agreed
//! byte for byte on 235 vectors. **This codec has no such run yet**, and the reason is
//! worth stating plainly rather than burying: the J2735 modules are git-ignored (build
//! decision D3) and **are not in this checkout** — `third_party/asn1/j2735/` does not
//! exist — so the ASN.1 could not be re-read while this module was written, and the
//! oracle's Python environment is not on this machine either.
//!
//! What the structure below rests on instead, field by field:
//!
//! | Element | Evidence |
//! |---|---|
//! | `SPAT` preamble: 1 extension bit + 3 optional bits (`timeStamp`, `name`, `regional`) | corroborated: the derivation table in [`crate::size_model`], written while the modules *were* on disk, states "SPAT preamble (1 extension + 3 optional bits)" |
//! | `IntersectionStateList` `SIZE(1..32)` → 5-bit determinant | corroborated: same table, "`IntersectionStateList` length 5 b" |
//! | `IntersectionState` preamble: 1 + 6 optional bits | corroborated: same table, "one `IntersectionState`: 1+6 preamble" |
//! | `IntersectionReferenceID`: 1 optional bit + 16-bit `IntersectionID` | corroborated: same table, "`id` 1+16" |
//! | `revision` `MsgCount` 7 bits, `status` 16 bits, `moy` 20 bits, `timeStamp` 16 bits | corroborated: same table, and `MsgCount`/`DSecond` are the oracle-validated constants [`crate::j2735::bsm::MSG_COUNT_MAX`] and [`crate::j2735::bsm::D_SECOND_MAX`] |
//! | `MovementList` `SIZE(1..255)` → 8-bit determinant | corroborated: same table, "`MovementList` length 8" |
//! | `MovementState`: 1 + 3 optional bits, `signalGroup` 8 bits, `MovementEventList` 4-bit determinant | corroborated: same table, "`MovementState` 1+3+8+4 b" |
//! | `MovementEvent`: 1 + 3 optional bits | corroborated: same table, "`MovementEvent` 1+3+…" |
//! | `MovementPhaseState`: 10 root values, **4 bits** | **recalled, and it contradicts the size model**, which counted 5 bits for `eventState`. A non-extensible 10-value `ENUMERATED` is 4 bits under X.691 clause 14.3, so either the type carries an extension marker (making it 1 + 4) or the size model's derivation is one bit out. See [`MOVEMENT_PHASE_STATE_WIDTH_IS_DISPUTED`]. |
//! | `TimeChangeDetails`: 5 optional bits, no extension bit; `TimeMark` 16 bits | corroborated: same table, "`TimeChangeDetails` 5 optional bits + three `TimeMark` at 16 b" |
//! | `MinuteOfTheYear (0..527040)`, `TimeMark (0..36001)`, `SignalGroupID (0..255)`, `IntersectionID`/`RoadRegulatorID (0..65535)`, `TimeIntervalConfidence (0..15)` | recalled from SAE J2735 2024-09; **not re-read** from the module |
//! | `DSRCmsgID signalPhaseAndTimingMessage(19)` | recalled; anchored by `basicSafetyMessage(20)` in [`crate::j2735::bsm::BSM_MESSAGE_ID`], which the oracle validated, and 18/19/20 are consecutive in the same list |
//!
//! So: the bytes this module produces are **real UPER of a real structure**, not a fill
//! pattern, and every field is a genuine encoding of the value handed to it. They are not
//! yet *proven* conformant. [`crate::evidence`] is the machine-readable form of that
//! distinction, and the model card of [`crate::j2735::infra::J2735InfraCodec`] states it in
//! words. Do not upgrade either without an oracle run.
//!
//! # The shape of a SPaT, as encoded here
//!
//! ```text
//! SPAT                        extensible SEQUENCE, 3 optional fields

//! ```
//!
//! Everything marked *refused* is [`CodecError::UnsupportedConstruct`] on decode and is
//! never written on encode, so its preamble bit is always zero. Nothing is skipped: PER
//! carries no tags, so stepping over an element the codec does not model would misread
//! every element after it.
//!
//! # Units are the standard's
//!
//! Every field holds the wire integer. [`minute_of_the_year`], [`d_second`] and
//! [`time_mark`] are the only conversions, and they quantise on the grids of build
//! decision D9 before scaling, exactly as [`crate::j2735::bsm`] does.
