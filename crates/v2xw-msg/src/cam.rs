//! Building, encoding and decoding a real ETSI CAM.
//!
//! The message is ETSI TS 103 900 (CAM, Release 2) over ETSI TS 102 894-2 Release 2. This
//! module turns the simulator's own state — a node's [`PositionEstimate`], its station
//! type, its body dimensions and a few vehicle dynamics — into a `CAM` the generated
//! bindings can encode, and encodes it with real UPER.
//!
//! # What goes in
//!
//! Everything comes from *belief*, never from ground truth: [`CamInput::position`] is the
//! output of the node's GNSS model, which is where the position error, the outage and the
//! spoofing live. A generator that reached past it into the world would make every
//! position-plausibility detector trivially perfect (invariant I-C2,
//! [`v2xw_core::nodeview::NodeView`]).
//!
//! # What comes out
//!
//! A `CAM` with the two mandatory containers — basic and high-frequency — and optionally
//! the low-frequency container, whose cadence EN 302 637-2 §6.1.3 fixes at "the first CAM,
//! then every ≥ 500 ms" and which [`crate::generator::CamGenerator`] schedules.
//!
//! # Size
//!
//! A typical unsecured CAM of this shape encodes to about 60 bytes of UPER
//! ([`tests::typical_cam_size_is_consistent_with_the_field_range`] pins the exact number).
//! 04-models.md §8.2 reports *secured, captured* CAMs of 182–199 B at minimum and 357 B on
//! average; the gap is the security envelope and the lower layers, and the test does that
//! arithmetic explicitly rather than leaving the reader to wonder whether 60 B is wrong.
