//! Message generation rules — the `MessageGenerator` seam of 03-interfaces.md §6.
//!
//! A generator decides **when** a node sends and **what shape** the message has. It does
//! not build the message and it does not encode it: that is [`crate::cam`] and
//! [`crate::codec`]. Keeping the two apart is what lets the CAM triggering rules be tested
//! against the standard's own numbers without an ASN.1 encoder anywhere in the test.
//!
//! Two generators live here, with the parameters 04-models.md §8.1 cites:
//!
//! * [`CamGenerator`] — `generator/cam-en302637-2`, the real EN 302 637-2 V1.4.1 §6.1.3
//!   state machine: `T_CheckCamGen`, the three dynamics triggers, the adaptive `T_GenCam`,
//!   the `N_GenCam` reset and the 500 ms low-frequency container.
//! * [`BsmGenerator`] — `generator/bsm-j2945-1`, 10 Hz nominal with Part I in every
//!   message.
//!
//! # Why the trait is generic and the state machine is not
//!
//! [`v2xw_core::ctx::Ctx`] and [`v2xw_core::nodeview::NodeView`] both carry associated
//! types, so `&mut dyn Ctx` on its own does not name a type. [`MessageGenerator`] therefore
//! takes the context and the view as type parameters; once the engine fixes them,
//! `dyn MessageGenerator<EngineCtx, EngineNodeView>` is an ordinary trait object, which is
//! how in-process plug-ins are called (ADR 0007 §8).
//!
//! The decision logic itself is a plain struct — [`CamTriggerState`] — that takes a time,
//! a [`CamDynamics`] and a [`DccState`] and returns a [`CamDecision`]. Every trigger path
//! is unit-tested through that struct directly, with no engine, no node and no ASN.1.
//!
//! # Belief, not truth
//!
//! Both generators read the node's position from [`v2xw_core::nodeview::NodeView::position`],
//! which is the GNSS model's *estimate*. A generator that used ground truth would make a
//! spoofed vehicle send CAMs on its real trajectory while claiming a false one — the exact
//! opposite of what a spoofing attack does (invariant I-C2).
