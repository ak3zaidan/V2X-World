//! The misbehaviour-scenario foundry: a quality-diversity search over scenario space for
//! the cases a detector misses.
//!
//! Ported from `legacy/scms_sim_ref/datagen/foundry.py` against the experiment runner, per
//! 07-threats-and-detection.md §2.3: *"the genome becomes a scenario overlay …, the
//! descriptor keeps the four legacy axes (family, density band, topology, attacker band)
//! and gains `rat` and `protocol`, the objective reads `det_recall`, `time_to_detect`, or
//! `residual_harm` from the metrics, and the LLM mutation operator hook is unchanged.
//! Elite replay is a scenario file plus a seed."*
//!
//! # What it is, in one paragraph
//!
//! MAP-Elites. The search keeps **one elite per descriptor cell** rather than one global
//! best, so the archive it produces is *diverse by construction* — a representative of
//! every corner of the space it reached — and *hard by construction* — within each corner,
//! the most evasive scenario found. The result is a detector blind-spot map: where the
//! **fixed** detector fails, and where the coverage is thin.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use v2xw_experiment::foundry::{FoundryOptions, Objective, RandomMutation, search};
//! use v2xw_engine::Scenario;
//! # use v2xw_experiment::runner::RunExecutor;
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! # let executor: &dyn RunExecutor = unimplemented!();
//! let base = Scenario::load("scenarios/revocation-latency.yaml")?;
//! let options = FoundryOptions::new("runs/foundry").budget(60).objective(Objective::Evade);
//! let archive = search(&base, executor, &RandomMutation, &options)?;
//! println!("{} of {} cells filled", archive.coverage(), options.grid_size());
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! # The search never weakens the detector
//!
//! Every mutation operator in [`RandomMutation`] perturbs an **adversary, environment or
//! topology** knob. None of them touches `detection.local`, `detection.ma`,
//! `security.verification_policy` or any detector threshold. That is not a convention: it
//! is the difference between an archive that maps the blind spots of the production
//! detector and an archive that maps the blind spots of a detector the search quietly
//! switched off, and the second is worthless. [`MutationOperator::propose`]'s output goes
//! through [`RandomMutation::TOUCHES`]'s path list before it is run, so an *injected*
//! operator — a language model, say — cannot weaken the detector either, however it was
//! prompted.
//!
//! # The validity gate
//!
//! A candidate is archived only if it was a real misbehaviour scenario:
//!
//! 1. **at least one true attacker existed** — `det_tp` + `det_fn` at `level=vehicle`; and
//! 2. **the reporting pipeline actually fired** — `det_tp` + `det_fp` at `level=report`.
//!
//! The second is the one that matters, and it is the legacy gate's own hard-won lesson: a
//! scenario with attackers that nobody ever observed scores `recall = 0` and therefore
//! `evade` fitness 1.0, and would be archived as the "hardest" elite — so the search would
//! then actively chase scenarios in which *nobody looked*. A genuine blind spot (reports
//! did fire, and missed the attackers) is preserved, because that is the jackpot the
//! search exists to find.
//!
//! # Three honest divergences from the Python foundry
//!
//! 1. **`family:<F>` is a *gate*, not a per-family recall.** The legacy objective read
//!    `recall_by_family[F]` out of `validate.py`. This engine's `det_recall` carries a
//!    `level` dimension and no family dimension, so there is no per-family recall to read.
//!    [`Objective::TargetFamily`] therefore scores `1 − det_recall` and *gates out* any
//!    candidate whose attacker family is not the target — which tests family F, by
//!    restricting the population rather than by slicing the metric. Owed, to close it
//!    properly: a `Dim::Family` on the detection provider, fed from `gt.attack.action`.
//! 2. **The density band comes from the *declared* demand rate, not the realised vehicle
//!    count.** The legacy descriptor binned `summary["vehicles"]`. There is no run-level
//!    vehicle-count or density metric in `v2xw-metrics` (`density` is per lane, keyed by
//!    `Dim::Region`), and [`crate::runner::RunArtifacts`] carries no count either. So the
//!    axis is a configuration axis. It is a weaker descriptor — two cells in the same band
//!    can have realised densities that differ by a factor of two — and it is stated rather
//!    than papered over. Owed: a `vehicles` count metric, or a field on `RunArtifacts`.
//! 3. **`residual_harm` is not an available objective.** §2.3 names it and
//!    `v2xw-metrics` has no provider for it. Rather than ship an objective that can never
//!    be valid, it is absent, and this is the note that says so.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! * Nothing is drawn outside the [`v2xw_core::rng`] registry. The driver's own randomness
//!   comes from one **ephemeral** stream per iteration, keyed by
//!   `(RngDomain::plugin("experiment/foundry/map-elites"), EntityRef::custom(.., iteration))`,
//!   so the sequence a given iteration sees is a function of the master seed and the
//!   iteration index alone — not of how many candidates happened to be infeasible before
//!   it.
//! * Every per-candidate engine seed is derived by SHA-256, never sampled
//!   ([`derive_candidate_seed`]).
//! * The archive is a [`BTreeMap`], so `archive.json` is byte-identical for one
//!   `(budget, seed, objective)` triple.
//! * **No wall clock is read.** The wall-clock seconds an executor reports are recorded
//!   and never read back.
//!
//! An *injected* operator that consults external state — a language model — makes the run
//! non-deterministic by design. [`crate::foundry_eval`] is what measures whether that buys
//! anything.
