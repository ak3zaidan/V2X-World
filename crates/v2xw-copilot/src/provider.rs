//! The language-model seam.
//!
//! The owner specified OpenAI, and [`crate::openai`] is that. The seam exists anyway,
//! because a research tool that can only be run against one vendor's endpoint is a
//! research tool with a dependency its results are hostage to: a model deprecated upstream
//! takes the copilot with it, a local model cannot be compared against, and an
//! air-gapped installation cannot run it at all. So the vendor lives behind
//! [`LlmProvider`], which is four small types and one method.
//!
//! [`ScriptedProvider`] is the same seam used the other way: the whole tool loop of
//! [`crate::session`] is exercised with a scripted model, no key and no network.
