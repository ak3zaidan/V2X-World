//! End-to-end delay, decomposed: the general trace, and the provider that reduces it.
//!
//! # The trace
//!
//! A message's latency is not one number but a journey: it waits for the signer, is
//! signed, waits for the channel, is on the air, propagates, is parsed, waits for the
//! verifier and is verified. A backend flow is the same shape with other stages — a
//! cellular uplink, a registration authority's processing, a backhaul hop, a CRL's
//! distribution. [`LatencyTrace`] is that shape, once, for every flow:
//!
//! * an origin instant (the message's generation, or a request's issue);
//! * an ordered list of [`Span`]s, each naming a **stage** and a **hop**, that tile the
//!   interval from the origin to the delivery with no gap and no overlap.
//!
//! Because the spans tile the interval, their durations sum to the end-to-end latency
//! *exactly*, in integer nanoseconds — the decomposition cannot drift from the total, and
//! [`LatencyTrace::validate`] refuses a trace for which that is not true (a gap, an overlap,
//! a negative stage). The consistency requirement "latency stages sum to the end-to-end
//! latency" is therefore a property of the type, and a producer that violates it produces
//! a rejected trace that [`LatencyProvider`] counts on `latency_trace_rejected` rather than
//! a plausible-looking wrong number.
//!
//! # How a flow plugs in
//!
//! * **V2V** messages are decomposed from `node.rx`, which carries every stamp of the
//!   journey; [`crate::channels::NodeRxView::latency_trace`] builds the trace with the
//!   stages of [`crate::channels::V2V_STAGES`] and the flow name `v2v`.
//! * **Any other flow** — multi-hop forwarding, credential top-up, misbehaviour reporting,
//!   CRL distribution — emits a [`LatencyTrace`] record on the `msg.latency` channel, built
//!   with [`TraceBuilder`], with its own flow name and its own stage names. Nothing in this
//!   module needs to know them in advance: a stage is a label, and the provider reduces
//!   whatever stages a flow reports. Multi-hop flows set [`TraceBuilder::hop`] between
//!   hops, so a relay's queueing is distinguishable from the originator's.
//!
//! # Metrics
//!
//! | Metric | Formula | Unit |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `e2e_latency` | delivered − origin, per delivered message | ms (distribution: p50, p95, p99) |
//! | `latency_stage` | one stage's duration, per delivered message | ms (distribution) |
//! | `latency_stage_share` | Σ one stage's durations / Σ end-to-end latencies | ratio of sums |
//! | `latency_trace_rejected` | traces that failed [`LatencyTrace::validate`] | count |
//!
//! `latency_stage_share` is a ratio of *sums*, so over one window and one flow the shares
//! of all stages add up to exactly one (before quantisation); the mean of per-message
//! shares would not, and would weight a 1 ms message like a 100 ms one.
