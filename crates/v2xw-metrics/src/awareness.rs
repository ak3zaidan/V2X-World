//! Awareness and freshness: what each vehicle knows about its neighbours, and how old it is.
//!
//! Delivery ratio says whether a message arrived. A cooperative-awareness application
//! cares about something else: whether, at a given instant, it holds a *recent* state for
//! *every* vehicle near it. Three metrics answer that, all from `node.rx` (what each
//! receiver actually handed to its applications) joined to `gt.kinematics` (where every
//! vehicle really was):
//!
//! | Metric | Formula | Unit | Source |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `aoi` | time-average age of information per directed link: ∫ (t − g(t)) dt / ∫ dt, where g(t) is the generation time of the freshest message the receiver holds from that sender | ms | Kaul, Gruteser, Rai, Kenney, "Minimizing age of information in vehicular networks", IEEE SECON 2011; Kaul, Yates, Gruteser, IEEE INFOCOM 2012 |
//! | `aoi_peak` | the age just before each update: t_delivered(k) − g(k−1) | ms (distribution) | Costa, Codreanu, Ephremides, "On the age of information in status update systems with packet management", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 62(4), 2016 |
//! | `nar` | Σ over receivers of (neighbours within R heard within T) / Σ (neighbours within R) | ratio | Boban and d'Orey, "Exploring the practical limits of cooperative awareness in vehicular communications", IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol. 65(6), 2016 (the neighbourhood awareness ratio); 08-measurement-and-data.md §2.1 (r = 100–300 m, T = 1 s) |
//! | `delivery_ratio` | messages delivered to the application / reception attempts resolved, per 50 m distance bin | ratio | 08-measurement-and-data.md §2.1 (`pdr` by `dist_bin`), applied at the application rather than the PHY |
//!
//! The inter-reception time `pir` (Martelli et al., IEEE INFOCOM 2012) is in
//! [`crate::comms`], where it has always been.
//!
//! # What is ground truth here
//!
//! All four read the sender's true identity, and `nar` reads true positions; every one is
//! tagged node-and-ground-truth (08-measurement-and-data.md §1). A real receiver cannot
//! compute them — it knows pseudonyms, not vehicles, and it does not know who it failed to
//! hear. That is exactly why a simulator should.
