//! | Metric | Formula | Unit | Source |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `channel_occupancy` | a node's own transmitted air time / window, across nodes | ratio (distribution) | 3GPP TS 36.214 §5.1.31 (channel occupancy ratio, CR, for LTE-V2X); ETSI TS 103 574 (the CR limit C-V2X congestion control enforces) — applied to 802.11p as the fraction of the window a node's own frames occupy |
//! | `channel_load` | (air time of every arrival at a node above the −85 dBm busy threshold + the node's own offered air time) / window | ratio (distribution; above 1 means more offered than the channel can carry) | Torrent-Moreno, Mittag, Santi, Hartenstein, "Vehicle-to-vehicle communication: fair transmit power control for safety-critical information", IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol. 58(7), 2009 (beaconing load at a location against the channel's capacity); EN 302 571 §4.2.10.1 (the −85 dBm threshold) |
//! | `offered_load` | PSDU bits handed to the MAC / window, network-wide | bit/s | — |
//! | `carried_load` | PSDU bits that went on the air / window, network-wide | bit/s | — |
//! | `loss_rate` | attempts lost for one cause / attempts resolved | ratio, per cause | 08-measurement-and-data.md §2.1 (`pdr_by_cause`), over attempts rather than over losses |
//! | `collision_rate` | attempts lost to a collision (collision, hidden terminal, resource collision) / attempts resolved | ratio | I-R3's cause list |
//! | `half_duplex_rate` | attempts lost because the receiver was transmitting / attempts resolved | ratio | IEEE 802.11p is half duplex |
//! | `mac_queue_depth` | frames waiting in a node's EDCA queues at each MAC report | count (distribution) | IEEE 802.11-2020 §10.23.2 |
//! | `mac_drops` | frames the MAC refused | count | — |
//! | `mac_access_delay` | preamble on the air − frame handed to the MAC | ms (distribution) | IEEE 802.11-2020 §10.23.2 (AIFS + backoff + deferral) |
