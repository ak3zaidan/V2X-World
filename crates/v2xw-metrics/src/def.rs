//! [`MetricDef`] and [`MetricSample`]: what a metric *is*, and one measurement of it.
//!
//! 03-interfaces.md §10 publishes the definition type as
//!
//! ```text
//! pub struct MetricDef { name, unit, dims, agg, visibility, definition_md, source }
//! ```
//!
//! and this is that type, with four fields the design's principles imply but the sketch
//! does not spell:
//!
//! | Added field | Why it has to be on the definition |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`MetricDef::quantum`] | Build decision D9: "Every schema field that carries a float declares its quantum … The quantum is part of the field's contract". A metric value *is* such a field, and the writer needs the grid at the point it writes. |
//! | [`MetricDef::min_samples`] | "A bin with too few samples reports as insufficient rather than as a point estimate." The threshold is part of the metric's contract, not of the caller's mood. |
//! | [`MetricDef::not_accounted`] | 08-measurement-and-data.md §1: "no black box". Every model card carries `ignores`; a metric that does not say what it leaves out invites the reader to assume it leaves out nothing. |
//! | [`MetricDef::diagnostic`] | 08 §2's runtime numbers are machine-dependent. The flag is what [`crate::DigestSet`] partitions on, so the exclusion is structural rather than a convention. |
//!
//! `MetricDef` is what the catalog page is generated from (§1: "The catalog page is
//! generated from the definitions, so the docs cannot drift from the code"), which is why
//! `definition_md` holds the formula in prose and `source` holds the citation.
