//! The records the security lifecycle and the backend put in a recording.
//!
//! Three of them are the design set's own channels with a reader already in
//! `v2xw-metrics` — `proto.revocation` (the revocation decomposition, PUBLIC), `sec.cert`
//! (credential lifecycle events) and `net.bytes` via [`crate::records::NetBytes`] — and are
//! written through the reader's view, so writer and reader cannot disagree about a field.
//! Two are new and have no reader outside this crate yet:
//!
//! * `sec.pseudonym` — one row per pseudonym change, naming every identifier that changed
//!   together (certificate digest, the BSM temporary ID or CAM station ID, and the
//!   link-layer source address) and what the pool looked like afterwards;
//! * `node.security` — one row per node per telemetry window: its certificate pool, its
//!   current pseudonym, its backend link and its revocation state. This is what a chase
//!   view's security panel reads.
//!
//! `privacy.link` is `v2xw-threat`'s own record, written by the passive observer.
