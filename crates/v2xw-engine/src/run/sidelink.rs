//! The LTE-V2X and NR-V2X sidelink access layer, driven by the engine's event loop.
//!
//! `radio.rat: lte-v2x-pc5` and `nr-v2x-pc5` select it, and `radio.models.sidelink`
//! configures it (profile, MCS, blind retransmissions, congestion control). What it
//! composes is `v2xw-radio`'s own sidelink stack:
//!
//! * [`v2xw_radio::SpsEngine`] — sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling: the sensing
//!   window, RSRP exclusion with the 3 dB step-up, S-RSSI ranking, the random pick, the
//!   reservation with `C_resel` and `probResourceKeep`, blind-retransmission resources,
//!   the CBR/CR congestion control, and for NR the Rel-16 re-evaluation and pre-emption
//!   (04-models.md §5.1 steps 1-7, §5.2);
//! * [`v2xw_radio::SidelinkPhy`] — half duplex, the SCI drawn against the control
//!   channel's BLER, the sensitivity floor, per-sub-channel SINR with in-band emission from
//!   co-slot transmitters on other sub-channels, and the BLER lookup with chase combining
//!   of blind retransmissions.
//!
//! # How the event loop drives a slotted MAC
//!
//! A frame whose signature has finished waits in the engine's `pending_tx` exactly as an
//! 802.11p frame does, and a [`crate::event::Event::MacTimer`] at the ready instant hands
//! it to the SPS engine. A timer that does not fall on a slot boundary only enqueues and
//! re-arms at the next boundary, because a transport block can only start at one. At a
//! boundary the engine polls: a UE with no reservation (or one the MAC triggers of
//! TS 36.321 §5.14.1.1 invalidate) selects a resource `T1..T2` slots ahead, and a UE whose
//! reservation — or owed blind retransmission — is this slot is granted and goes on the
//! air at once, unless congestion control drops it. The next timer is the MAC's own
//! [`v2xw_radio::SpsEngine::next_grant_at`].
//!
//! Every co-slot transmission starts at the same instant, so when a frame starts, every
//! frame already started in its slot is exactly its interferer set; the two cross-declare
//! at each shared receiver, as the 802.11p path does. The outcome is decided at the slot's
//! end (`PhyEnd`, priority 3), which the kernel dispatches before any `MacTimer` of the
//! next slot (priority 4) — so by then the slot's transmitter set is complete.
//!
//! # What each receiver senses
//!
//! Each transmission puts its received power, split over its sub-channels, into every
//! in-range UE's S-RSSI history as it starts; a jammer's energy goes in the same way
//! ([`v2xw_radio::SpsEngine::note_jammer`]). The S-RSSI is what the CBR counts against
//! −94 dBm (ETSI TS 103 574 §5.2) and what step 5 ranks by. A UE learns a neighbour's
//! *reservation* only from an SCI it decoded: at the slot's end the PHY draws each
//! receiver's SCI against the control channel's BLER at the control channel's SINR —
//! interference included — and only a decoded SCI puts the announced resources, at their
//! PSSCH-RSRP (per resource element, TS 36.214 §5.1.29), into the sensing window.
//!
//! # Blind retransmissions
//!
//! With `max_transmissions` above one, each transport block is sent on up to three
//! resources the SPS engine reserved together (inside ±15 subframes for LTE, 32 slots for
//! NR). A receiver decodes each copy; a copy whose SCI it decoded goes into its soft
//! buffer, and the next copy is decoded at the combined SINR. The reception is recorded
//! once per transport block and receiver: when a copy first decodes (so the latency is
//! that copy's), or when the last copy fails. A copy that arrives after the receiver has
//! decoded is a duplicate the MAC discards, and is not a second reception.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! * **Mode 3 / Mode 1** (base-station scheduled): out of coverage is the V2V case the
//!   J3161/1 deployment profile specifies, and nothing schedules from a gNB here.
//! * **MCS and sub-channel adaptation** under congestion: the UE gives up its blind
//!   retransmissions and then the transport block, which ETSI TS 103 574 §5.3 allows; it
//!   does not raise its MCS, which J3161/1's per-CBR MCS ranges would also allow.
//! * **SAE J3161/1 §7.3.3's SPS + one-shot interleaving.**
