//! [`EngineCtx`] — the engine's implementation of [`v2xw_core::ctx::Ctx`], and the sink it
//! emits into.
//!
//! This is the concrete context 03-interfaces.md §1.1 describes and build decision D12.2
//! arbitrates around. It binds the three associated types the contract crate leaves open:
//!
//! | Associated type | Bound to | Why it could not be concrete in `v2xw-core` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `World` | [`v2xw_world::World`] | lives in `v2xw-world`, above the contract crate |
//! | `Actors` | [`ActorSnapshot`] | lives in `v2xw-mobility`, above both |
//! | `Payload` | [`crate::Event`] | lives here, above everything (D8) |
//!
//! # Borrowed, not owned
//!
//! `EngineCtx` holds borrows rather than owning the kernel, so the engine can hand a model
//! a context while holding that model mutably — `mobility.step(&mut ctx, dt)` with both
//! `mobility` and the scheduler living in the same `Engine`. An owning context would make
//! that a double borrow of `self` and every phase would need a `take`/`put` dance around
//! it, which is exactly the shape in which a model gets dropped on an early return.
//!
//! # `schedule` cross-checks its class
//!
//! [`Ctx::schedule`] takes an [`EventClass`] *and* a payload, and [`crate::Event::class`]
//! already answers the same question from the payload — by a match the compiler checks.
//! The engine panics when the two disagree rather than trusting the argument, because the
//! failure a wrong class produces is a silent reordering: a `NodeTask` scheduled at
//! `Control` priority runs before the mobility step of its own instant and reads the
//! previous step's kinematics, and nothing in the output says so.
