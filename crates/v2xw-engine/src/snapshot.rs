//! The normative binary snapshot stream: `Keyframe` and `Delta` frames
//! (`docs/protocol/vwp-v1.md` §3.3, §3.4).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The Phase 1 build recorded only the serde record path. `RecordingWriter::write_frame`
//! was called from nowhere, so a recording held `gt.kinematics` rows and no snapshot
//! frames at all: a browser could not replay a run, and §7.2's byte-identity guarantee
//! between a live stream and a replayed one was unexercised because there was no live
//! stream to be identical to. This is the producer side of that path.
//!
//! # It does not encode anything itself
//!
//! Every quantised integer, every column layout and the whole keyframe/delta decision is
//! [`v2xw_record::SnapshotEncoder`]'s. This module's whole job is to turn the engine's
//! own state — the actor table, the node table and the Phase 2 attacker set — into the
//! [`v2xw_record::Snapshot`] the encoder takes, once per mobility step. A second encoder
//! here would be a second answer to "what are the bytes", which is the one thing §7.2
//! forbids; `v2xw-record`'s pose quantisation is the one that is measured against the
//! 0.0005 m bound over 100,000 steps, so it is the one that is used.
//!
//! # Slots, and why they are allocated here
//!
//! §3.3.1 indexes keyframe rows **by slot**, not by actor id, and §3.3.1's slot rule —
//! lowest free slot, no reuse until one keyframe period after a despawn — is
//! [`v2xw_record::SlotAllocator`]'s. The engine holds the allocator because it is the
//! engine that knows when an actor appeared and when it left.
//!
//! # Cadence
//!
//! One delta per mobility step and one keyframe per [`v2xw_record::Cadence`]
//! `keyframe_period`; the encoder decides which of the two a step produces. The default
//! is a keyframe every simulated second, which is §3.1.1's default and what the finding
//! this module closes asks for. [`snapshot_cadence`] derives it from the scenario's
//! mobility step, because `Cadence::new` requires the keyframe period to be a whole
//! number of steps and a 30 ms step does not divide a second.
//!
//! # What is not filled in yet, stated rather than stubbed
//!
//! * **Spawn and despawn causes** (§3.4.5, §3.4.6) are written as `0xFFFF`, "unknown".
//!   The engine publishes an actor's disappearance one step after it leaves its own
//!   table, so the cause would have to be carried across a step to reach the frame that
//!   reports it; nothing reads the field yet, and an invented cause code is worse than an
//!   honest "unknown".
//! * **Signals.** Each frame's signal block (§3.3.3) carries one row per signal head
//!   group, the state the world's fixed-time plan gives that group at the frame's time —
//!   the same plan the mobility engine's vehicles obey, evaluated the same way
//!   ([`v2xw_world::World::group_signals`]), once [`SnapshotStream::with_signals`] has
//!   been given the world. It used to be empty: a recording played back in the page
//!   drew every lamp as "no data".
//! * **`verified_neighbors`** is the node's own count of peers in state *verified*
//!   ([`v2xw_node::NeighborTable::counts`]), saturating at 255 as §3.3.2 requires. An
//!   unequipped actor has none and the column is zero.
