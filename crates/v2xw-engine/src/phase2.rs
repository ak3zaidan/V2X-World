//! The security lifecycle and the backend: credentials, pseudonyms, misbehaviour
//! reporting, the Misbehaviour Authority's decision, revocation and CRL distribution.
//!
//! 10-roadmap.md's Phase 2 is a *path*, not a feature list: a vehicle detects another one
//! lying about its position, files a misbehaviour report, the report crosses the
//! vehicle's backend link to the Misbehaviour Authority, the authority decides on
//! sustained evidence, the PCA and both Linkage Authorities identify the device, the CRL
//! Generator issues on its cadence, the list is distributed by cellular download and by
//! roadside broadcast, and every vehicle that installs it stops trusting the liar. This
//! module wires that path across the crates that model each piece and **reimplements
//! none of them**:
//!
//! | Piece | Whose | What this module does with it |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the attacker | [`v2xw_threat::LegacyAttacker`] | calls `act` on the outgoing claim before it is signed |
//! | the detector suite | [`v2xw_threat::Legacy12`] | feeds it the messages the node's own runtime delivered |
//! | the report | [`v2xw_threat::MisbehaviourReport`] | builds one `from_verdict`, at most once a second per subject per reporter |
//! | the access leg | [`crate::backend::BackendAccess`] | cellular Uu, roadside relay, or none |
//! | the backend | [`v2xw_proto::ScmsRun`] | run **in lockstep** with the engine's clock: RA shuffles, PCA and LA lookups, CRL cadence |
//! | the decision | [`v2xw_threat::LegacyWindow`] | `detection.ma`: k trusted reporters, distinct seconds, a span, a window |
//! | the CRL | [`v2xw_sec::linkage::CrlLinkageEntry`] | installs it in the receiving node's own `CrlGate` |
//! | enforcement | [`v2xw_node::stores::CrlGate`] | the node's own revocation check does the rest |
//!
//! # Why honest traffic used to be revoked
//!
//! The Phase 2 wiring took the authority's decision itself: whenever it held two reports
//! about two pseudonyms it asked the Linkage Authorities whether they belonged to one
//! device, and revoked if they did. The Linkage Authorities answer *linkage*, not
//! *guilt*: two honest receivers reporting one honest vehicle across a pseudonym change —
//! a Gauss–Markov GNSS burst of 3 s at six times the nominal noise is exactly that, and
//! the legacy engine says its burst length was chosen to be shorter than "the revocation
//! persistence gate" — is correctly linked, and was revoked. The persistence gate is the
//! legacy authority's `threat/ma/legacy-window` (k = 3 trusted reporters, reports in 4
//! distinct seconds spanning at least 3.0 s inside a 15 s window; `PipelineConfig`
//! `report_threshold_k`, `revoke_min_seconds`, `revoke_persist_s`, `revoke_window_s`), and
//! it ships in `v2xw-threat` — it was simply not on this path. It is now: the decision is
//! the pipeline's, and the backend only carries it out.
//!
//! # The joints, stated
//!
//! **1. The air credential is the SCMS credential's shape, with a stand-in key.** Each
//! credential carries the linkage value and the i-period the SCMS provisioning issued, and
//! the validity window of that period, so a CRL entry revokes exactly the certificates the
//! protocol says. The signing key and the certificate bytes are the node's own
//! (`ObuRuntime` issues a real certificate for each pseudonym on first use), because the
//! credential protocol's key material is not handed to the node (build decision D11).
//!
//! **2. The subject lookup.** A report names a certificate by its digest; the engine maps
//! digest → `(node, i, j)` from what it provisioned, standing in for the PCA's own table.
//! The PCA's *service time* for that lookup is charged by the backend.
//!
//! **3. Pre-run provisioning.** A vehicle on the road already holds its pool, so each
//! vehicle's first batches are provisioned *before* the run on a scratch kernel
//! ([`v2xw_proto::ScmsRun::preload`]) — real butterfly expansion, real LA and PCA state —
//! and the run's own backend clock starts clean. Top-ups during the run are real in-run
//! flows over the vehicle's access link.
//!
//! **4. The access leg of multi-message flows.** A report's upload and a CRL download are
//! carried packet by packet by the vehicle's own Uu model or relay. A top-up's exchange
//! (request, acknowledgement, batch polls) runs inside the backend kernel over a link set
//! to the access's nominal latency and capacity at the instant it starts.
