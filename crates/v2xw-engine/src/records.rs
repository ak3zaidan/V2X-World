//! The writer-side record types, one per channel the engine emits.
//!
//! 03-interfaces.md §14 says "a plug-in reaches this table through one Rust type per
//! channel implementing [`Record`]". `v2xw-metrics` already publishes a *reader-side*
//! view per channel ([`v2xw_metrics::channels`]) — the shape a metric provider decodes.
//! Rather than declare a second, independently mutable struct per channel, each type here
//! is a `#[serde(transparent)]` newtype **around the reader's own view**.
//!
//! That is the point, and it is not a shortcut: writer and reader cannot disagree about a
//! field name, a unit or an optionality, because there is one struct and the wrapper adds
//! only the two constants [`Record`] needs — the channel id and the visibility tag. The
//! defect this closes is the commonest one in a recording pipeline: a producer renames a
//! field, every consumer silently reads `None`, and the metric goes quietly to zero.
//! `every_record_round_trips_through_its_reader_view` is the test that keeps it closed.
//!
//! # Quantisation
//!
//! Build decision D9: every float reaching a recorded artefact is on its field's declared
//! grid. Each constructor here quantises on the way in — metres and seconds at 1e-3, dB at
//! 1e-2 — so a caller cannot emit an unquantised value by forgetting to.
