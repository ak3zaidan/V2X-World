//! The main loop and the phase-parallel structure of ADR 0004.
//!
//! # Shape of a run
//!
//! One single-threaded event loop over one heap, and a small number of *phases* that are
//! pure maps merged in id order. The loop never runs two events at once; the phases never
//! touch the heap while they are mapping. That split is ADR 0004 decision 5, and it is
//! what makes thread count change wall time and nothing else.
//!
//! ```text
//! pop (time, priority, seq)
//!   ├─ Control      p0  scenario timeline: weather, outage, demand, parameter change
//!   ├─ MobilityStep p1  ── phase ──► map over actors (mobility provider), merge by ActorId
//!   │                    publish Kinematics, rebuild the snapshot, spawn/retire nodes
//!   ├─ PhyEnd       p3  ── phase ──► map over that frame's receivers, merge by NodeId
//!   ├─ PhyStart     p5  one frame goes on the air; its receiver set is resolved at PhyEnd
//!   ├─ NodePhase    p6  ── phase ──► map over nodes, merge by NodeId; node-local queues
//!   │                    are drained *inside* the map and never reach the heap
//!   └─ Observe      p9  metric flush, and the end-of-run sentinel
//! ```
//!
//! # The mobility step publishes the instant it is dispatched at
//!
//! A mobility step dispatched at `t` advances the world to `t + dt`, so what it produces
//! describes the *end* of the step. The phase therefore publishes in this order:
//!
//! ```text
//! MobilityStep at t
//!   1. gt.kinematics for every actor, stamped at t  (what the previous step produced)
//!   2. one VWP Keyframe or Delta at t               (the same state, binary, §3.3/§3.4)
//!   3. mobility.step(dt)                            (the world advances to t + dt)
//!   4. absorb, reindex, beliefs
//! ```
//!
//! Publishing the step's own result instead would file every record one mobility step
//! before the state it describes, against the record's own `t` field — which is what the
//! vertical-slice audit found. Steps 1 and 2 are two encodings of one fact and are
//! deliberately adjacent: `tests/wire.rs` checks they agree, which neither can satisfy by
//! being self-consistent.
//!
//! The binary stream is [`crate::snapshot`]. It is what a browser replays, and the Phase 1
//! build produced none of it at all: `RecordingWriter::write_frame` was called from
//! nowhere, so a recording carried JSON records and no snapshot frames.
//!
//! # Between mobility steps
//!
//! Mobility is periodic (ADR 0004 decision 2). A radio event at `t′` strictly inside a
//! step reads a position from the **published extrapolation rule**,
//! `pos(t′) = pos(t) + vel(t)·(t′ − t)` — [`v2xw_core::kinematics::Kinematics::extrapolate`],
//! which is part of the interface contract (03-interfaces.md §3, invariant I-M4) and not
//! an engine convenience. [`Engine::position_at`] is the one place that rule is applied, so
//! a second, subtly different extrapolation cannot appear in a second phase.
//!
//! # Time dilation
//!
//! 02-architecture.md §5.4: a scenario may declare windows in which only the backend and
//! the abstract mobility tiers run, so a 24-hour credential experiment finishes in
//! minutes. The engine implements that by **not generating radio events** inside a window:
//! `PhyStart` is not scheduled, so no frame, no reception and no verification cost exist
//! for that period. The windows are in the manifest, and [`RunReport::suppressed_frames`]
//! counts what was skipped, because a metric that silently reads zero inside a window is
//! indistinguishable from a channel that was quiet.
//!
//! # What this loop does not do yet
//!
//! Stated rather than stubbed:
//!
//! * **Interference and capture.** A reception outcome here is a link-budget decision
//!   against the noise floor, so SINR is SNR: concurrent frames do not raise each other's
//!   denominator. That is `v2xw-radio`'s `OfdmPhy` high tier and a `MacTimer`-driven MAC,
//!   and both are scheduled through the event classes this enum already carries.
//! * **The MAC.** A frame reaches the air after the signing latency plus one AIFS; there
//!   is no backoff, no CBR measurement and no DCC gate. `Event::MacTimer` is the class
//!   those live at.
//! * **Backend, credential protocol and detection.** `Event::NetDeliver` and
//!   `Event::FlowTimer` are their classes; nothing schedules them here.
//!
//! Each gap is a missing *model*, not a missing seam: the event class, the phase and the
//! record channel for each already exist.
