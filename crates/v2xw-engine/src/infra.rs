//! What a roadside unit at a signalised junction broadcasts: SAE J2735 SPaT and MAP, and
//! their ETSI SPATEM and MAPEM wrappings, built from the world the run is simulating.
//!
//! # Where the content comes from, and why that is not a firewall breach
//!
//! A deployed RSU does not measure the signal: the traffic signal controller tells it,
//! over NTCIP 1202 or the TSCBM block on a wire in the cabinet, and the RSU encodes what
//! it was told. The junction's geometry is a survey the operator loaded into it. So the
//! two inputs here are the RSU's own infrastructure feeds — the controller state and the
//! surveyed map — and handing them to the unit is the same act as handing a vehicle its
//! GNSS fix. The node runtime still only signs and sends bytes; it never sees the world.
//!
//! # The signal state is the engine's own
//!
//! [`IntersectionFeed::spat_at`] evaluates the junction's [`SignalPlan`] at the instant the
//! message is generated with [`SignalPlan::phase_at`] — the function the mobility model's
//! fixed-time controller (`mobility/intersection/signal-fixed-time`) runs to decide who may
//! enter — and reports each signal *group* the way [`SignalPlan::group_timelines`] does,
//! which is what the page colours each lamp with. So a receiver's view of a light, the
//! lamp on the page and the rule the drivers obey are one function of one plan at one
//! instant. Each group's time to change (`minEndTime`, and `maxEndTime` equal to it: a
//! fixed-time plan's changes are certain) is the time to that group's next state change,
//! read ahead through the plan's own phases.
//!
//! # The geometry
//!
//! One `IntersectionGeometry` per junction, with its reference point at the junction's
//! centre. Every approach lane that feeds a controlled movement is an ingress lane, every
//! lane a controlled movement leaves on an egress lane, and each ingress lane connects to
//! its egress lanes under the signal group of the lamp that faces it (the plan's heads).
//! Node lists run from the stop line outwards, as J2735 lays them, for up to
//! [`LANE_SPAN_M`] along the centreline.
//!
//! # What is uncertain, stated
//!
//! * The SPaT and MAP encoders are hand-written against J2735 and are **not
//!   oracle-validated** (`v2xw_msg::evidence`); the bytes are real UPER of the structure
//!   the codec models.
//! * SPATEM and MAPEM are an ETSI `ItsPduHeader` (message ids `spatem(4)` and `mapem(5)`,
//!   protocol version 2) followed by the SPAT and MAP of ISO TS 19091's DSRC module, whose
//!   structure for the fields filled here is J2735's. The header is 48 bits, octet
//!   aligned, so the wrapping is the two encodings back to back. The protocol version and
//!   the identity of the two structures are recalled, not re-read (TS 103 301 and ISO TS
//!   19091 are not in this repository).
//! * `layerType` and `layerID` are not written, so a MAP here is a conformant `MapData`
//!   encoding but not a CTI 4501-conformant message (`v2xw_msg::j2735::map`).
//! * Which junction a unit serves: the nearest signalised junction within
//!   [`SERVICE_RADIUS_M`] of its mast — a unit is wired to one controller, and one RSU per
//!   intersection is the connected-intersection deployment pattern. A unit with a SPaT or
//!   MAP role and no junction in reach is a scenario error, reported at build.
