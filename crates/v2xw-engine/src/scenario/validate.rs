//! Scenario validation: 03-interfaces.md §13's "actionable errors".
//!
//! The requirement is specific, and it is the reason this module is not a pile of
//! `assert!`s: an error must name **the field** and **the conflict**, in the author's own
//! vocabulary, as in §13's own example —
//!
//! ```text
//! radio.tiers.phy: 'high' requires mac 'high' (mac is 'medium')
//! ```
//!
//! Every rule below produces that shape: [`ScenarioError::Conflict`] with a dotted
//! `field` a UI can highlight and a `conflict` that states the offending value, the rule
//! and the *other* value that the rule conflicts with. An error that says only "invalid
//! tier combination" sends the author back to the specification; this one does not.
//!
//! # All of them, not the first
//!
//! [`validate`] returns **every** problem, in a fixed order (the order of the schema's own
//! fields), because an author fixing a scenario wants the list rather than one round trip
//! per mistake. [`crate::scenario::Scenario::validate`] returns the first for callers that
//! only need pass or fail.
