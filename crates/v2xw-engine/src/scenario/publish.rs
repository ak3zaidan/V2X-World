//! The published scenario surface: what a generated settings form is built from.
//!
//! 13-product-direction.md §2 settles the shape of the problem. The scenario has around
//! twenty top-level sections with deep nesting and the model registry holds every model's
//! parameters with their units, defaults, ranges and cited sources; hand-written forms
//! would cover a subset on the day they were written and drift the day after. So the form
//! is *generated*, and this module is what it is generated from.
//!
//! The rule that makes it worth trusting: **nothing here names a scenario field.** The
//! field tree comes from a build-time reflection of `schema.rs` itself (see the crate's
//! `build.rs`), the ranges and closed value sets come from the tables the loader's own
//! validator reads ([`crate::scenario::validate::BOUNDS`],
//! [`crate::scenario::validate::CHOICES`]), the implementation status comes from
//! [`crate::scenario::validate::KEY_STATUS`], and the model parameters come from the
//! registry's cards. A field appears in the page because it exists in the type, not
//! because somebody remembered it.
//!
//! # What is published
//!
//! | Key | What it is |
//! |---|---|
//! | `schema` | JSON Schema 2020-12 over the whole scenario, with `unit`, `default`, `x-status` and `x-path` on every node |
//! | `fields` | the same tree flattened to one row per editable leaf, which is what a searchable form wants |
//! | `groups` | the sections, in the order a user thinks about them |
//! | `slots` | every place the scenario picks a model, with the ids that are selectable there |
//! | `models` | every registered model: its card, its parameters with units, defaults, ranges and sources, and its `todo: calibrate` list |
//! | `statuses` | the implementation-status vocabulary, so the page can render it without hard-coding the words |
//!
//! # The three guarantees the tests hold
//!
//! * **No field the loader accepts is missing.** `every_shipped_scenario_is_described`
//!   walks each scenario in `scenarios/` and requires the schema to describe every key in
//!   it.
//! * **No field the loader rejects is offered.** `the_published_defaults_load` builds a
//!   document out of the published defaults and feeds it to the loader, whose
//!   `deny_unknown_fields` rejects an invented key.
//! * **No field is offered unclassified.** `every_leaf_has_a_status` requires every leaf
//!   to match a [`KEY_STATUS`](crate::scenario::validate::KEY_STATUS) row, so a new field
//!   cannot reach the page without someone saying whether the engine acts on it.
