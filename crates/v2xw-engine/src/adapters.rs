//! One context adapter per family (build decision D12.2).
//!
//! # The problem D12.2 solved
//!
//! [`v2xw_core::ctx::Ctx`] has three associated types, and one of them — `Payload` — is
//! the engine's concrete [`Event`](crate::Event), which lives *here*, above every model
//! crate. A model crate therefore cannot spell `dyn Ctx<…>`: naming the payload would
//! invert the dependency the whole layering exists to keep straight.
//!
//! Two answers were tried in the Phase 1 build and D12.2 arbitrated between them:
//!
//! | Approach | Crate | Dyn-compatible? | Verdict |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | A narrowed per-family context trait plus an adapter | `v2xw-mobility` (`MobCtx`), `v2xw-node` (`NodeCtx`) | yes | **chosen** |
//! | Generic over `C: Ctx + ?Sized` | `v2xw-sec`, `v2xw-radio` | only while no method is generic over the context | should converge |
//!
//! The narrowed trait wins because ADR 0007 §8 requires in-process plug-ins to be trait
//! objects, and the generic form loses dyn-compatibility the moment any method takes a
//! second generic parameter. It also states, in the trait itself, exactly what a family
//! may touch — which is how `v2xw-node`'s [`NodeCtx`](v2xw_node::NodeCtx) manages to have
//! no `world()` at all, making invariant I-C2 a property of the signature rather than of a
//! reviewer's attention.
//!
//! # What this module is
//!
//! The engine's half of the bargain: one adapter per family, so no phase driver writes
//! `v2xw_mobility::CoreCtx(&mut ctx)` by hand and no family is adapted two different ways
//! in two different phases. Each function here is one line; the value is that there is
//! exactly one of them per family and that this table is where a reader finds out which
//! families are narrowed and which are still generic.
//!
//! | Family | How it takes a context | Adapter |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Mobility, car-following, lane change, routing, demand, VRU, GNSS, clock | `&mut dyn MobCtx` | [`mobility`] |
//! | Node runtime, verification policy, generator | `&mut dyn NodeCtx` | [`node`] |
//! | Propagation, fading, obstacle, PHY, MAC, DCC | `C: Ctx + ?Sized` | [`radio`] |
//! | Crypto backend, security envelope | `C: Ctx + ?Sized` | [`security`] |
//!
//! The last two rows are the convergence D12.2 asks for and this crate does not own; see
//! [`SEC_CONVERGENCE`] for what the change costs, measured against the code rather than
//! estimated.

/// The narrowing is the strongest one in the system: [`v2xw_node::NodeCtx`] has `now`,

/// piece of code with a legitimate reason to hold a node and a context at once — cannot

    v2xw_node::CoreCtx(ctx)
}

/// The radio family takes the context generically, so the adapter is the identity.
///
/// It exists so that a phase driver names the family it is calling into, and so that this
/// module's table has a row for every family rather than a gap a reader has to interpret.
/// When `v2xw-radio` converges on a narrowed `RadioCtx`, this is the one place that
/// changes.

/// What converging `v2xw-sec` on a narrowed context trait would cost, measured.
///
/// D12.2 says `v2xw-sec` "should converge" and leaves the size of that change open. The
/// measurement, taken against the crate as it stands:
///
/// * `CryptoBackend<C: Ctx + ?Sized>` and `SecurityEnvelope<C: Ctx + ?Sized>` are the only
///   two generic traits.
/// * Between them they touch **two** context methods: `ctx.rng(RngDomain::Crypto,
///   EntityRef::Node(owner))` in `crypto::draw_seed`, and `ctx.now()` in
///   `<Envelope as SecurityEnvelope<C>>::sign`. Nothing reads `world`, `actors`,
///   `schedule`, `cancel`, `emit` or `params`.
/// * So the narrowed trait is `trait SecCtx { fn now(&self) -> SimTime; fn rng(&self,
///   domain: RngDomain, entity: EntityRef) -> RngGuard<'_>; }` — a strict subset of
///   [`v2xw_node::NodeCtx`], and a blanket `impl<C: Ctx + ?Sized> SecCtx for CoreCtx<'_, C>`
///   is the same five lines `v2xw-mobility` and `v2xw-node` already carry.
///
/// **Verdict: a small change, not its own pass.** It is a mechanical substitution of
/// `&mut dyn SecCtx` for `ctx: &mut C` across two trait definitions, their two
/// implementations (`Modeled`, `Real`, `Envelope`) and the crate's `TestCtx`, which
/// already implements the full `Ctx` and would keep doing so. The one thing to watch is
/// that `SecurityEnvelope::sign` takes `crypto: &mut dyn CryptoBackend<C>`, so the two
/// traits have to be converted together or the bound does not type-check halfway.
///
/// It is not done here because this crate does not own `crates/v2xw-sec`, and because the
/// generic form is *correct today*: `EngineCtx` satisfies `C: Ctx`, both traits are still
/// dyn-compatible as written (no method is generic over anything but the trait's own
/// parameter), and the conformance test in this module proves it by building the trait
/// objects.

/// A [`v2xw_radio::Propagation`] the engine can **store**.
///
/// Worth spelling out, because it is the strongest argument in the D12.2 convergence and
/// it is not the dyn-compatibility one. `Propagation<C>` is generic over the context, and
/// the engine's context is [`EngineCtx<'a>`] — a type with a lifetime. So
/// `Box<dyn Propagation<EngineCtx<'?>>>` has no lifetime to write: `'static` is wrong
/// (the engine never has a `&mut EngineCtx<'static>`), and a borrowed lifetime cannot
/// outlive the phase that created the context. A scenario-selected propagation model
/// therefore **cannot be a boxed trait object at all** while the family is generic over
/// the context.
///
/// This trait is the escape: it fixes the context at the engine's own type with a
/// higher-ranked blanket implementation, so any model that is `Propagation` over *every*
/// `EngineCtx` lifetime becomes one storable trait object. A narrowed `RadioCtx`, as
/// `v2xw-mobility` and `v2xw-node` already have, would delete this trait and its
