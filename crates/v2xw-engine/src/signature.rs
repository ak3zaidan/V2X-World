//! `security.signature`: what the chosen signature scheme adds to every signed message.
//!
//! The node's security stack signs and verifies with ECDSA P-256 (`v2xw-node`'s
//! `SIGN_PRIMITIVE`), and a real SPDU is encoded around that signature. IEEE 1609.2's
//! `Signature` CHOICE has alternatives for NIST P-256 and P-384 and brainpool P-256/P-384,
//! and **no** post-quantum alternative is standardised (`v2xw_sec::SigToken`'s refusal
//! says so). So the other schemes are modelled by what they change on the air — the
//! octets — over the P-256 SPDU the node really built:
//!
//! | `security.signature` | Per signature | Per attached certificate | Source |
//! |---|---:|---:|---|
//! | `ecdsa-p256` | 0 | 0 | the measured envelope (04-models.md §9.1) |
//! | `ecdsa-brainpoolp256r1` | 0 | 0 | same field sizes: a 256-bit curve's `r`, `s` and compressed point (IEEE 1609.2 `EcdsaP256Signature`, `EccP256CurvePoint`) |
//! | `ecdsa-p384` | +32 | +48 | 48-byte `r` and `s` against 32 (+32); a 49-byte compressed key against 33 (+16) and the issuer's P-384 signature (+32) — `EcdsaP384Signature`, SEC 1 §2.3.3, derived |
//! | `hybrid-falcon512-ecdsa-p256` | +666 | +1,563 | the ECDSA signature stays and a Falcon-512 signature is concatenated (666 B padded, PQClean `falcon-padded-512`); the certificate adds the Falcon public key (897 B) and a Falcon signature by its issuer (666 B) — 04-models.md §9.4, 05-protocols.md §5.3 ("raw concat", derived) |
//! | `hybrid-mldsa44-ecdsa-p256` | +2,420 | +3,732 | ML-DSA-44 signature 2,420 B, public key 1,312 B [FIPS 204 Table 2], concatenated the same way |
//!
//! The post-quantum half's signing and verification *time* is charged elsewhere: on the
//! node by `v2xw_node::profile::signature_ops` (both halves' published costs), and in the
//! credential system by `v2xw_proto::hybrid`. The Partially-Hybrid design of NDSS 2024
//! that fragments the hybrid certificate across a certificate cycle is `net.fragmenter`'s
//! job. A hybrid SPDU above the network
//! layer's MTU is refused before the MAC and counted (`net_mtu_refusals`), which is the
//! air-interface consequence 05-protocols.md §5.3 describes.
