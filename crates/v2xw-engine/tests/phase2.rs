//! The Phase 2 path: a report becomes a vehicle that cannot sign.
//!
//! 10-roadmap.md Phase 2 acceptance item 2 is "every stage timestamp in 05-protocols §8 is
//! emitted and the latency decomposition renders". These tests assert on the path and on
//! the decomposition, and — because the whole point of this file is a check that could
//! pass while doing nothing — each assertion is paired with the same scenario with one
//! piece removed.
//!
//! # The scenario the tests run
//!
//! `phase2-manhattan.yaml` places a roadside unit at every signalised intersection of 5th
//! and 6th Avenues (55 units) with building obstruction on. Every unit is a receiver of
//! every frame in range, and a debug build spends most of a run's time in the reception
//! phase, so the tests thin the deployment to every third unit on each avenue (the path is
//! the same one; only the number of masts differs) and shorten nothing else.
//! [`the_shipped_scenario_builds_with_its_whole_deployment`] builds the shipped file as it
//! is, so the thinning cannot hide a scenario that does not load.
