//! The node's own security stack: real payloads, real signatures, real bytes.
//!
//! # What this module exists to stop
//!
//! Until 2026-09-22 a node's `generate` path called neither a codec nor a crypto backend.
//! It produced a `u32` — `93 + signer identifier`, with a zero payload — and handed that
//! to the engine as if it were a message. The tell an audit found before reading a line of
//! code: a basic safety message and a cooperative awareness message both came out at
//! exactly 101 bytes. Two different standards, two different formats, two different field
//! sets, one number. That cannot happen to real bytes, and it is why
//! [`crate::runtime::ObuRuntime`] now encodes and signs for real and why the first test in
//! `tests/wire_bytes.rs` is that the two sizes *differ*.
//!
//! It matters more here than it would in most projects: security overhead as a fraction of
//! airtime, verification cost under load and what a node does when it cannot keep up with
//! signing are the three headline results this simulator exists to produce, and all three
//! are ratios whose numerator was a constant.
//!
//! # The three pieces
//!
//! | Piece | What it is |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`SecCtx`] | the bridge from [`NodeCtx`] to [`v2xw_core::ctx::Ctx`], which `v2xw-sec` is generic over. It carries **no** world and **no** actors: both associated types are `()`, and [`crate::firewall::scan_security_bridge`] fails the build if either stops being. |
//! | [`NodeCrypto`] | the backend, `real` or `modeled`. Nothing outside this enum branches on which — invariant I-S1, and Phase 1 acceptance criterion 3. |
//! | [`NodeSecurity`] | the envelope, the signer handles, and the stand-in credential issuance that keeps a node signing while no `CredentialProtocol` plug-in ships. |
//!
//! # The stand-in issuer, and what it is not
//!
//! 03-interfaces.md §7 puts enrolment and provisioning in a `CredentialProtocol` plug-in
//! that does not exist yet. A node still has to sign with *some* key under *some*
//! certificate, and `v2xw-sec` will not sign without both. So [`NodeSecurity`] issues its
//! own: one local authority per node, and one explicit pseudonym certificate per
//! credential the store holds, issued by it.
//!
//! What that gives is real: a real P-256 key, a real IEEE 1609.2 certificate with a real
//! linkage value, a real `HashedId8`, and a signature a relying party can check against
//! the certificate the SPDU carries. What it does **not** give is a chain to a common
//! trust anchor — each node's authority is its own — so a receiver here verifies the
//! signature against the signer's certificate and cannot conclude that the certificate was
//! issued by anyone it trusts. That is a gap in the credential protocol, not a gap in the
//! cryptography, and it is stated rather than papered over: see
//! [`NodeSecurity::verify_parsed`], and [`SpduVerdict::Unverifiable`], which is what a
//! receiver answers rather than guessing when it holds no certificate for the signer.
