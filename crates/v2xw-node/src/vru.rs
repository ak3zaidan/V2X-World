//! The vulnerable-road-user device: what makes a pedestrian audible on the channel.
//!
//! `v2xw-mobility` already walks pedestrians and cyclists with a social-force model
//! (04-models.md §2.5). What that produces is a *body* moving through the world. This
//! module is the **device** the body is carrying: a handset or a pedestrian beacon that
//! transmits a personal safety message (SAE J2735 PSM, per J2945/9) or a VRU awareness
//! message (ETSI TS 103 300-3 VAM), under the two constraints a hand-held radio has and a
//! roof-mounted one does not.
//!
//! # The constraints are the point
//!
//! A VRU device is not a small OBU. Two limits decide whether a pedestrian is detectable
//! at all, and neither applies to a vehicle:
//!
//! **Duty cycle.** EN 302 571 V2.1.1 §4.2.10.2 caps any ITS-G5 transmitter at a 3 % duty
//! cycle with `T_on ≤ 4 ms` and `T_off ≥ 25 ms`, whatever the congestion-control algorithm
//! decides (04-models.md §6). [`DutyCycle`] enforces exactly that, over the same one-second
//! observation window `v2xw-radio`'s DCC models use, and it computes the air time from
//! [`v2xw_radio::air_time`] — the OFDM parameters, not an assumed rate. At the VAM's
//! fastest permitted cadence the cap is not binding; in a burst, or with a large payload,
//! it is, and [`VruDeviceRuntime::duty_cycle_refusals`] counts what it stopped.
//!
//! **Energy.** A vehicle's radio is powered by the vehicle. A handset's is powered by a
//! battery whose capacity no source in the design set gives, and 06-node-models.md §7
//! publishes no VRU-device profile at all: `power_w` on
//! `vru-device/handset-generic` is `NOT PUBLISHED` with the measurement that would publish
//! it. So [`PowerBudget`] is **declared and inert** by default: it accounts the energy
//! every transmission costs, from the transmit power and the real air time, and it refuses
//! nothing until a scenario supplies a capacity. That is the honest shape — a default
//! battery would silently set the transmit budget of every run that forgot to configure
//! one — and it is why [`PowerBudget::battery_j`] is an `Option`.
//!
//! # What is transmitted
//!
//! | Message | Cadence | Payload | Status |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | PSM | [`PsmGenParams`], default 1 Hz | SAE J2735 UPER, `v2xw_msg::j2735::psm` (mandatory fields, `Position3D`, `MessageFrame`: 31 octets) | rate `TODO: calibrate`; bytes real, not yet oracle-validated |
//! | VAM | [`vam_gen_params`], the TS 103 300-3 §6.2 triggers | ETSI UPER generated from TS 103 300-3 V2.2.1, `v2xw_msg::vam` (basic, high-frequency and — on the low-frequency cadence — low-frequency containers) | triggers VERIFIED; bytes generated from the module |
//!
//! Both payloads are real wire bytes built from the device's own belief, and
//! [`PayloadProvenance::Encoded`] says so on every frame. [`modelled_payload`] keeps the
//! size-model rows reachable for a study that wants them, and says which row it used.
//!
//! The **security envelope around the payload is real**: the SPDU is built and signed by
//! [`crate::secure::NodeSecurity`] exactly as a vehicle's is, so the signing cost, the
//! certificate-attachment cadence and the envelope overhead are the real ones. The
//! published 235–350 B VAM figures are *secured-message* sizes: the payload here is the
//! bare facilities PDU, and the envelope those figures include is one this runtime really
//! builds around it.
//!
//! # What it reads
//!
//! Its own belief and its own clock, like every other runtime here. The VAM triggers are
//! evaluated against a [`PositionEstimate`], so a pedestrian with a poor urban fix
//! transmits at a different rate from one with a clear sky — which is the phenomenon, not
//! an artefact.

/// 5,000 ms in place of 100 ms and 1,000 ms, and a low-frequency container "first, then
/// every ≥ 2,000 ms" in place of every ≥ 500 ms. So
/// [`v2xw_msg::generator::CamTriggerState`] is the state machine, parameterised. Writing a
/// second copy of the same rules would be the way the two answers to "was a message due"

/// Both are on the card as limitations rather than approximated:
///
/// * the **trajectory-interception** trigger ("probability change > 10 %"), which needs the
