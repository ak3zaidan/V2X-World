//! Safety applications over the neighbour table, and the surrogate measures they emit.
//!
//! This is the module that turns a communication result into a safety result, which
//! 00-design-brief.md §1 names as the point of the whole simulator. A node that receives
//! messages runs an application over them; the application decides whether to warn its
//! driver; and each decision carries the surrogate safety measures 04-models.md §11
//! defines, so the chain from "the frame was lost" or "the frame was a lie" to "the
//! warning did not fire" or "the warning fired for nothing" is measurable.
//!
//! # What an application may read
//!
//! Exactly two things: this node's own [`PositionEstimate`] and this node's own
//! [`NeighborTable`]. Both are beliefs. The neighbour table holds the position a peer
//! **claimed** and the instant this node believes it heard the claim, and nothing else —
//! see [`crate::stores::Neighbor`], and [`crate::firewall`] for the sentinel that keeps
//! it that way.
//!
//! That is what makes a ghost vehicle produce a false warning here. An application
//! evaluating its thresholds against the truth would never warn about a vehicle that does
//! not exist, and the false-warning rate — the quantity 07-threats-and-detection.md §5
//! says the engine must *measure* because no published experiment gives it — would come
//! out as identically zero.
//!
//! # The three applications
//!
//! | Model id | What it warns about | 04-models.md §11 status |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`Fcw`] (`safety-app/fcw-vsca`) | a rear-end collision with a vehicle ahead in the same direction | threshold UNVERIFIED |
//! | [`Ima`] (`safety-app/ima-vsca`) | a crossing conflict at an intersection | threshold UNVERIFIED |
//! | [`Eebl`] (`safety-app/eebl-vsca`) | a vehicle ahead braking hard | the 0.4 g flag is VERIFIED |
//!
//! Every numeric trigger 04-models.md §11 marks `TODO: calibrate` is carried here as a
//! `todo-calibrate` card parameter with a plan, never as a plausible default in silence.
//! The one number that is cited is the deceleration at which J2945/1 sets the BSM Part II
//! event flag, [`EEBL_DECEL_THRESHOLD_MPS2`].
//!
//! # The surrogate measures, and how they differ from the metric crate's
//!
//! `v2xw-metrics`'s `metric/safety/surrogates-and-flow` computes `ttc_min`, `pet` and
//! `drac` over **ground truth**, which is the right thing for "how dangerous was this
//! run". [`Surrogates`] is the same family of quantities computed over **what the node
//! believed**, which is the right thing for "what did the application have to go on".
//! Both are needed and they are not interchangeable: their difference under attack *is*
//! the attack's effect on safety, and a single ground-truth number cannot express it.
//! The two are therefore kept on different channels — the metric crate's on
//! `metric.sample`, these on `app.warning` — and the field names are the ones vwp-v1
//! §3.6.9 gives.
//!
//! # Quantisation
//!
//! Every float that reaches a [`WarningRecord`] is quantised at construction to
//! [`SURROGATE_Q`] (build decision D9). `NaN` passes through unchanged, because it is the
//! wire's "not applicable" sentinel and vwp-v1 §3.6.9 says so for `ttc_s`.
