//! The roadside-unit runtime: roles, failure states, and store-and-forward.
//!
//! # Why this is not a configuration of the vehicle runtime
//!
//! It was, and the code said so. `v2xw-engine`'s `build_rsu` put an
//! [`crate::runtime::ObuRuntime`] on an RSU hardware profile with
//! `ServiceSet { cam: false, bsm: false }` and a comment recording what was missing:
//! "06-node-models.md §3's RSU runtime — roles, failure states, a store-and-forward queue
//! — does not ship in `v2xw-node`. So the RSU receives, its detectors run, and it puts a
//! revocation list on the air when the backend hands it one."
//!
//! Everything the design specifies beyond that is *between* the antenna and the backend,
//! and a vehicle has none of it:
//!
//! * **roles** ([`RsuRole`]) — a unit broadcasts SPaT and MAP, or proxies certificate
//!   provisioning, or forwards misbehaviour reports, or distributes a revocation list, or
//!   several, and a scenario says which. A vehicle has no roles;
//! * **failure and compromise states** — `down`, `degraded` and `compromised` are states
//!   of a *mast with a backhaul*, and a vehicle that lost its backhaul lost nothing;
//! * **store-and-forward** ([`ForwardQueue`]) — a unit with no backhaul holds what it was
//!   given until it has one, drops it when it ages out, and reports both.
//!
//! Adding three optional subsystems to the vehicle runtime would have put them in the path
//! of every vehicle in every run, and the roles would have been an enum nobody read.
//!
//! # What is shared, and where the sharing lives
//!
//! The queue-and-server structure, the stores, the verification policies, the clock model,
//! the security stack and the telemetry record are all the same code: 06-node-models.md §3
//! says an RSU "has the same queue/server structure as the OBU with a larger profile", and
//! it does, because [`crate::queue`], [`crate::server`], [`crate::stores`],
//! [`crate::policy`], [`crate::clock`], [`crate::secure`] and [`crate::telemetry`] are
//! shared modules and not part of either runtime. What differs is this file.
//!
//! # A surveyed mast, not a fix
//!
//! An RSU knows where its own antenna is because a surveyor wrote it down, so
//! [`RsuRuntime::set_belief`] is handed a belief with no GNSS error in it — and the runtime
//! still reads it as a belief, because a compromised or misconfigured unit may hold a wrong
//! one and nothing here may consult the truth to find out ([`crate::firewall`]).
//!
//! # What it broadcasts, and what it cannot
//!
//! | Message | Cadence | Payload length |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | SPaT | 10 Hz (04-models.md §8.1's default, CTI 4501) | real octets from [`RsuRuntime::set_payload`], else `codec/size-model/j2735` |
//! | MAP | 1 Hz (ibid.) | as SPaT |
//! | CRL / CTL | on installation, and on [`RsuConfig::crl_repeat`] if a scenario sets one | the length the backend handed it |
//! | WSA | [`RsuConfig::wsa_period`], 1 per 5 s and UNVERIFIED | **none exists** |
//!
//! There is no WSA size model and no WSA encoder, so [`RsuConfig::wsa_payload_bytes`] is
//! `None` by default and a unit with the WSA role transmits nothing and counts it
//! ([`RsuRuntime::unsized_broadcasts`]). That is the shape 06-node-models.md §1 rule H1
//! demands of a missing number, applied to a missing message.
