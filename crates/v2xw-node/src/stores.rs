//! The node's stores (06-node-models.md §2.2): what it holds, what that costs it in
//! bytes, and what it throws away.
//!
//! Four of them have a cryptographic counterpart in `v2xw-sec` — [`v2xw_sec::CrlStore`],
//! [`v2xw_sec::PeerCertCache`], [`v2xw_sec::TrustStore`] and the certificate types — and
//! this module does not reimplement any of them. What it adds is the part that is a
//! *node* property rather than a cryptographic one: a capacity, an ageing rule, a byte
//! count, and, in one case, a bound on how much work an unauthenticated field may cause.
//!
//! # The bound, and why it is here rather than only in `v2xw-sec`
//!
//! A linkage CRL entry revokes a device from one i-period forward. Checking a certificate
//! against one means walking a hash chain from the entry's period to the certificate's,
//! then two AES blocks per candidate index. `v2xw-sec` already fixed the inner half of
//! this: [`v2xw_sec::linkage::CrlLinkageEntry::matches_any_index`] walks the chain once
//! per entry instead of once per index, and refuses a period more than
//! [`v2xw_sec::linkage::DEFAULT_MAX_FORWARD_PERIODS`] ahead of the entry.
//!
//! That leaves a second multiplier, and it belongs to the node. `iCert` is a field of a
//! certificate whose signature has not been checked yet, so it is attacker-controlled;
//! 156 periods forward, against a CRL with thousands of entries, is still a lot of hashing
//! to buy with one forged header. A node knows something `v2xw-sec` does not: which
//! i-period it is currently in. A certificate presented now legitimately carries the
//! current period, or the previous one during the one-hour overlap that CAMP's 10,140-
//! minute lifetime gives a 10,080-minute period — so anything outside a three-period
//! window around now is implausible on its face and is refused **before** the store is
//! touched at all. [`CrlGate`] is that check, it counts the work it does so a test can
//! see the bound holding, and [`CrlGate::check`] refuses to be called without saying
//! whether the certificate has been authenticated yet.
