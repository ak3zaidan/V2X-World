//! `v2xw-node` — the node runtime: what turns a vehicle into a communicating station.
//!
//! A node owns its beliefs and nothing else. It knows what its GNSS receiver told it,
//! what its oscillator says the time is, what it has received and what it holds in its
//! stores. It does not know where it is, what time it is, or who sent the message it is
//! looking at, and every number this crate produces is a number a fielded receiver could
//! also have produced (02-architecture.md §2, ADR 0010, invariant I-C2).
//!
//! # The three things this crate is for
//!
//! **Service time is real.** A node signs on the hardware its profile describes. The
//! reference OBU's secure element publishes `<9 ms signing latency` and `>110
//! signatures/s`; at 10 Hz that is 9 % of one engine, and a pseudonym change inside the
//! same 100 ms window has to fit beside it. A node under a hundred neighbours at 10 Hz
//! needs a kilohertz of verification throughput, and one of the profiles in
//! 06-node-models.md §7 documents a real automotive part that offers a hundred. So a node
//! here queues, delays and drops, and [`telemetry`] reports which of the three happened —
//! because that is the phenomenon the whole simulator exists to study, and a model with
//! instantaneous cryptography cannot produce it.
//!
//! **Nothing is invented.** A hardware profile is data with a citation per number
//! ([`profile`], [`profiles`]); a field no vendor publishes carries the measurement that
//! would publish it, and [`profiles::todo_calibrate_total`] counts them. An operation the
//! profile does not cost has *no* service time, not a plausible one: a default would set
//! the load of every run that forgot to configure it, invisibly.
//!
//! **The firewall is enforced, not asserted.** Build decision D11 §3 records that the
//! `NodeView` boundary is strong but not compile-proof and that enforcement belongs in a
//! conformance sentinel. [`firewall`] is that sentinel, `tests/firewall_sentinel.rs`
//! runs it over this crate's own source, and both name the faults that were injected to
//! prove they can go red.
//!
//! # Where to look
//!
//! | Concern | Module | Specification |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Hardware profiles: the schema, and the rule that nothing is invented | [`profile`] | 06-node-models.md §1 |
//! | The eleven shipped profiles and the todo-calibrate page | [`profiles`] | 06-node-models.md §7 |
//! | The narrowed engine context, with no ground truth on it | [`ctx`] | build decisions D12.2, D11 |
//! | The node's own clock, and how it drifts | [`clock`] | 06-node-models.md §2.3 |
//! | Bounded queues and drops by cause | [`queue`] | 06-node-models.md §2.1, §2.4 |
//! | CPU and HSM servers, and what an operation costs | [`server`] | 06-node-models.md §2.1, 03-interfaces.md §8 |
//! | Stores, pseudonym rotation, neighbour ageing, the bounded CRL check | [`stores`] | 06-node-models.md §2.2, 05-protocols.md §2 |
//! | verify-all, on-demand, prioritized | [`policy`] | 06-node-models.md §2.1, 03-interfaces.md §6 |
//! | BSM at 10 Hz, CAM on the EN 302 637-2 triggers | [`generate`] | EN 302 637-2 §6.1.3, SAE J2945/1 |
//! | The 208-byte `NodeTelemetry` record | [`telemetry`] | vwp-v1 §3.5.2 |
//! | The step function and the `NodeView` implementation | [`runtime`] | 06-node-models.md §2 |
//! | Roadside units: roles, failure states, backhaul, store-and-forward | [`rsu`] | 06-node-models.md §3 |
//! | VRU devices: PSM and VAM under a duty cycle and an energy budget | [`vru`] | 06-node-models.md §1, 04-models.md §8.1 |
//! | FCW, IMA, EEBL, and the surrogate measures they emit | [`safety`] | 04-models.md §11 |
//! | Real payloads, real signatures, real bytes | [`secure`] | IEEE 1609.2 §5.3.1, 04-models.md §9.1 |
//! | The ground-truth conformance sentinel | [`firewall`] | 03-interfaces.md §17, D11 |
//!
//! # What is not here yet
//!
//! Stated rather than stubbed, so that a reader can tell a gap from an omission:
//!
//! * **The credential protocol.** Top-up, enrolment and the SCMS/ETSI flows belong to a
//!   `CredentialProtocol` plug-in (03-interfaces.md §7). [`stores::CertStore`] holds what
//!   such a protocol issues and rotates it; nothing here requests a batch, so
//!   `next_topup_ns` is the "none scheduled" sentinel.
//! * **Backend runtimes.** 06-node-models.md §4 describes a backend entity as a
//!   `ServiceModel` with batching windows and an availability model. The profiles ship
//!   here ([`profiles`]) and `v2xw-proto`'s `ServiceQueue` is the queueing half; the node
//!   runtime for one does not.
//! * **Perception** (§6) and **air time** for a vehicle or a mast, which is the PHY's to
//!   compute. [`vru`] is the exception: a duty cycle is meaningless without air time, so a
//!   VRU device computes it from [`v2xw_radio::air_time`] and its telemetry's
//!   `airtime_ms_per_s` is real where a vehicle's is zero.
//!
//! # What arrived with the roadside, VRU and safety-application work
//!
//! Three of the gaps this list used to name are closed, and the closing is what
//! [`rsu`], [`vru`] and [`safety`] are:
//!
//! * the **RSU runtime** is its own runtime rather than a vehicle with its message
//!   services switched off, with the roles, the failure and compromise states and the
//!   store-and-forward queue 06-node-models.md §3 specifies;
//! * the **VRU device** is the thing `v2xw-mobility`'s pedestrians were missing: a handset
//!   or a beacon whose duty cycle and battery decide whether a pedestrian is detectable;
//! * the **safety-application relevance scores** the `on-demand` policy consumes now have
//!   a producer — [`safety::SafetyAppSet::relevance`] — and [`ObuRuntime::set_relevance`]
//!   installs them, so [`policy::OnDemand`] no longer sees `None` for every message.
