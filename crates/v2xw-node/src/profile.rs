//! Hardware profiles: the schema of 06-node-models.md §1, and the loader for the data
//! files that carry it.
//!
//! A profile is *data*, not code: a YAML file under `profiles/hardware/` whose every
//! numeric field carries either a citation or an explicit admission that the vendor does
//! not publish it, together with a plan for measuring it. Rule **H1** of §1 is that there
//! is no third case, and [`HardwareProfile::validate`] is where it is enforced; rule
//! **H2** is that a profile with no secure element says `hsm.kind: none` rather than
//! leaving the block empty, so that "all crypto runs on the CPU" is a stated decision
//! rather than an accident of an absent key.
//!
//! # Why a field is a sum type
//!
//! The obvious schema — `cores: u32` — cannot express what the hardware research sheet
//! actually found, which is that Cohda publishes the MK5's DMIPS rating and not its core
//! clock. Given a plain `u32` an implementer has exactly two options: invent a number, or
//! drop the field. Both are worse than the truth. [`Field`] is the truth: either a value
//! with the source it came from, or no value with the measurement that would produce one.
//!
//! The consequence is visible in the model card. A published field becomes a
//! [`v2xw_core::card::Parameter`] with a real [`v2xw_core::card::Source`]; an unpublished
//! one becomes a parameter whose source kind is
//! [`v2xw_core::card::SourceKind::TodoCalibrate`] carrying the calibration plan, which is
//! exactly what registry rule R1 reports on. Counting the second kind is how this crate
//! answers "how much of this profile is real".
//!
//! # Deviations from the document's YAML, and why
//!
//! §7 writes the alternative software-crypto cost tables as nested maps inside
//! `software_crypto` (`class_cortex_a53_1_2ghz: {…}`), and the Luna appliance's tier
//! table inside `hsm`. Both are carried here under their own top-level keys
//! (`software_crypto_classes`, `hsm_tiers`) so that `software_crypto` and `hsm.ops` have
//! one value type each and a reader never has to guess whether a key is an operation or a
//! class. No number and no citation is changed by the move. Unknown keys are ignored, as
//! §7's conventions paragraph requires, so the `# ext` fields (GNSS, OS, environmental)
//! survive in the file without the loader having to model them.
