//! The OBU runtime: the thing that turns a vehicle into a communicating station.
//!
//! # What a node is
//!
//! A node is a hardware profile, a set of queues and servers sized by it, a clock, a
//! position belief, a set of stores, a verification policy and a pair of message timers.
//! [`ObuRuntime::step`] drives all of it once per engine tick: generate, sign, hand to the
//! network layer; receive, verify, update the stores; and once per telemetry window,
//! report.
//!
//! # What a node is not
//!
//! It is not a view onto the simulation. [`ObuRuntime`] implements
//! [`v2xw_core::nodeview::NodeView`], and everything a detector, a generator, a safety
//! application or an attacker can see about this node is that trait's surface: its own id,
//! its own believed time, its own position estimate, its own credentials, its neighbour
//! table and what it has received. There is no accessor here that returns the truth,
//! because there is no way for this crate to obtain the truth: [`crate::ctx::NodeCtx`] has
//! no `world()` and no `actors()`.
//!
//! Build decision D11 is explicit that this firewall is strong but **not compile-proof** —
//! an implementor can still smuggle ground truth in through an associated type — and that
//! enforcement therefore belongs in a conformance sentinel. [`crate::firewall`] is that
//! sentinel. The claim made here is the one that is true: the ordinary route is closed,
//! and the unusual route is checked by a test that has been shown to fail when the route
//! is taken.
//!
//! # The two ground-truth values that do cross
//!
//! Two quantities in the telemetry record are marked **GT** in vwp-v1 §3.5.2:
//! `clock_offset_ns` and `pos_error_m`. Both are differences between a belief and a truth,
//! so neither can be computed inside the firewall. They enter through
//! [`ObuRuntime::observe_truth`], which the engine calls from *outside* — it is the
//! engine, not the node, that knows both numbers — and they are stored in a field that
//! nothing but the telemetry path reads. The sentinel checks that too, because a
//! ground-truth value that arrived legitimately and was then used illegitimately is
//! exactly the leak the firewall exists to stop.
