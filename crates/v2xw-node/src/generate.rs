//! When the node transmits: BSM at 10 Hz and CAM on the EN 302 637-2 triggers.
//!
//! The rules themselves live in `v2xw-msg` — [`v2xw_msg::generator::CamTriggerState`] is
//! the EN 302 637-2 §6.1.3 state machine and [`v2xw_msg::generator::BsmGenerator`] the
//! J2945/1 10 Hz cadence — and this module is the node-side wiring. It is a thin module
//! with one job, and the job is the one thing a generator can get catastrophically wrong:
//! **what it reads.**
//!
//! # The input is the belief, and only the belief
//!
//! [`MessageSchedule::due`] takes a [`PositionEstimate`] and a believed instant. It cannot
//! take ground truth, because ground truth is not in its signature and this crate has no
//! way to reach it (see [`crate::ctx`] and [`crate::firewall`]).
//!
//! That is not pedantry. A CAM is triggered when the vehicle has moved more than 4 m,
//! turned more than 4 degrees or changed speed by more than 0.5 m/s. Evaluate those
//! thresholds against the truth and the generation rate is a clean function of the
//! vehicle's motion; evaluate them against a GNSS belief with metre-scale noise and the
//! rate rises, because noise crosses a 4 m threshold on its own. The second is what
//! happens on a road. A simulator that produced the first would under-report channel load
//! in exactly the conditions — poor fix, urban canyon — where load matters most, and the
//! error would be invisible because both numbers look reasonable.
//!
//! The same argument applies to the clock: the intervals are measured on the sender's
//! believed time, so a node whose clock has been stepped generates at a visibly wrong
//! rate rather than at a correct one.
//!
//! # Provenance of the trigger block
//!
//! The CAM rule set is EN 302 637-2 V1.4.1 §6.1.3: dynamics triggers at Δposition > 4 m,
//! Δheading > 4°, Δspeed > 0.5 m/s, floored at `T_GenCamMin` (100 ms) and heart-beating
//! at `T_GenCamMax` (1,000 ms). A verified reference implementation of exactly this block
//! exists in the retired legacy engine at `legacy/reference/jvm/ScmsBeaconApp.java`
//! lines 140-154, and 01-inventory.md §3 singles it out as "a correct ETSI EN 302 637-2
//! CAM trigger block (heading > 4°, position > 4 m, speed > 0.5 m/s, 100 ms-1 s) worth
//! citing when the CAM generator is written". It is cited, and two of its details are
//! deliberately *not* reproduced:
//!
//! * the Java block compares the heading difference in degrees against `4.0` while
//!   reading a heading in degrees; this crate works in ENU radians throughout (build
//!   decision D6) and the threshold is `CamGenParams::FOUR_DEGREES_RAD`;
//! * the Java block reads `p.getX()`/`p.getY()` from the simulator's own position, which
//!   is ground truth. That is the legacy defect 01-inventory §3.3 records and the reason
//!   the firewall exists. The rule set is worth citing; the input is not.
