//! The IEEE 802.11p physical layer: `phy/80211p/ofdm-10mhz` (04-models.md §4.2, §4.7,
//! §4.8) and the receiver parameters of §3.7.
//!
//! What this module owns:
//!
//! * **Air time** ([`air_time`]), exact from the OFDM parameters: the 32 µs preamble, the
//!   8 µs SIGNAL field, and one 8 µs symbol per `N_DBPS` bits of
//!   `N_SERVICE + 8·bytes + N_TAIL`.
//! * **The receiver** ([`OfdmPhy::noise_floor_dbm`], [`SensitivityPreset`]): thermal noise
//!   −104 dBm in 10 MHz plus a noise figure, and the EN 302 663 sensitivity table.
//! * **SINR** ([`sinr_db`]), with the interference sum reduced in id order.
//! * **Frame outcomes** ([`OfdmPhy::finish_rx`]): half duplex, sensitivity, preamble
//!   capture, per-window SINR against the NIST PER model, and exactly one
//!   [`LossCause`] per lost frame (invariant I-R3).
//! * **Accounting** ([`AirtimeLedger`]): every transmission's air time counted once at the
//!   transmitter, and every arrival's air time attributed to exactly one outcome bucket at
//!   the receiver — the second half of I-R3.
//!
//! # What the engine does and what this does
//!
//! This crate has no event loop and no pairwise loss matrix, so the PHY is driven rather
//! than driving: the engine computes the received power of an arrival (with
//! [`crate::prop`], [`crate::obstacle`] and [`crate::fading`]) and registers it with
//! [`OfdmPhy::register_arrival`]; it declares its own overlaps with
//! [`InterferenceSource`]; it calls [`OfdmPhy::finish_rx`] at the arrival's end. The PHY
//! keeps the per-node state that makes those calls answerable — the live arrival set, the
//! node's own transmissions, the busy intervals — and nothing else.
//!
//! # The RNG domain of a frame error
//!
//! ADR 0004 §3's built-in domain list has no frame-error domain. Rather than borrow
//! `AbstractRx`, whose name promises the abstract tier, the per-frame Bernoulli draw comes
//! from `RngDomain::plugin("phy/80211p/ofdm-10mhz")`, the plug-in domain the core derives
//! from a model id as `0x8000_0000 | (LE_u32(SHA-256(id)[0..4]) >> 1)`. The high bit is
//! always set, so it can never collide with a built-in code, and it is keyed by
//! `EntityRef::LinkFrame { link, frame }` so the draw for one arrival does not depend on
//! how many other receivers were evaluated first (invariant I-R2). Adding a `FrameError`
//! variant to the core's domain list is a one-line change and is recorded on the card.

    ///    arrival is registered and never mutated by an evaluation, so the answer is a
    ///    pure function of the registered geometry.
