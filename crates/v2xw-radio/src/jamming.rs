//! Jammers: `attacker/jammer/constant`, `attacker/jammer/pulsed` and
//! `attacker/jammer/reactive` (04-models.md §12.3, 07-threats-and-detection.md §2.2).
//!
//! # A jammer is a transmitter with no protocol
//!
//! 04-models.md §12.3 says it in one sentence: "Jammers are `Attacker` models with
//! `TransmitRaw` actions and enter the interference sums of §4-5 as transmitters". So
//! there is no new mechanism here. A jammer raises the energy at every receiver in range;
//! the receiver's signal-to-noise path ([`crate::phy::OfdmPhy::sinr_windows`]) already
//! divides a wanted signal by noise plus everything else on the air, and jamming enters
//! that denominator exactly the way thermal noise does. What this module contributes is
//! *when* a jammer is on the air and *how much* power it puts there, with a card and a
//! citation per number.
//!
//! The division of labour with `v2xw-threat`: the jammer's **goals** (whom to follow,
//! when to start, what the operator declared it may do) are attacker logic and live
//! there, behind 03-interfaces.md §9's `Attacker` seam. The jammer's **emission** — the
//! duty cycle, the trigger threshold, the received power and the noise rise it causes —
//! is radio physics and lives here, because it is the [`crate::phy`] SINR path that
//! consumes it. A jammer's model card is a [`Family::Attacker`] card registered from this
//! crate for the same reason `phy/receiver/noise-sensitivity` is a PHY card: the numbers
//! it carries are the ones this crate reads.
//!
//! # Telling a jammed frame from a congested one
//!
//! This is the point of modelling jamming at all, and it is 04-models.md §12.3's own
//! detection cue: the reactive jammer "produces PDR = 0 dropouts uncorrelated with SINR
//! dips". A loss cause that said `collision` for a jammed frame would erase exactly that
//! signal, so [`crate::types::LossCause::Jammed`] is reported on a **counterfactual**:
//! the PHY evaluates the frame twice, once with the jamming power in the noise term and
//! once without, and against the *same* uniform draw. A frame that failed with the jammer
//! present and would have been decoded without it is `jammed`; a frame that would have
//! failed anyway is `collision`, `hidden-terminal` or `fading` as before. The rule is
//! exact rather than a heuristic threshold, it costs one extra deterministic evaluation,
//! and it cannot be confused with congestion because congestion is what the
//! counterfactual holds fixed. See [`crate::phy::OfdmPhy::finish_rx`].
//!
//! # What is not shipped, and why
//!
//! **`attacker/jammer/constant-pilot`.** 04-models.md §12.3 lists it with a cited total
//! power ([`PUNAL_PILOT_JAMMER_TX_POWER_DBM`], 2.42 dBm) but the mechanism is
//! subcarrier-selective: it jams the OFDM pilots only, and what that does to a frame is a
//! statement about channel estimation, not about the wideband noise floor. Neither
//! 04-models.md nor the cached Puñal study gives the mapping from pilot-only power to an
//! effective SINR penalty, and modelling it as a wideband jammer of 2.42 dBm would be a
//! fabricated number dressed as a cited one. Following this crate's stated policy (see
//! the crate docs, "What 'cited' means here, and where it stops"), the model is **not
//! shipped**; the cited power is kept as a constant so that whoever reads the channel
//! estimation loss out of a primary source has the anchor waiting.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! The pulsed jammer's phase is one draw from `(RngDomain::Attack, EntityRef::Node(jammer))`,
//! taken once and cached, so its window list is a pure function of `(seed, node, period,
//! duty)` and not of how often the engine asked. The other two models draw nothing. Every
//! window list is in `(from, to)` order and every power sum goes through
//! [`crate::numeric::sum_powers_mw`], which sorts by [`NodeId`].
