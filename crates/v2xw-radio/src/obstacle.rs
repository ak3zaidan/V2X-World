//! Obstacles: `obstacle/building/sommer-2011`, `obstacle/vehicle/tr37885-nlosv`,
//! `obstacle/vehicle/knife-edge-boban` and `obstacle/terrain/knife-edge-p526`
//! (04-models.md §3.5).
//!
//! # The building geometry, and the R-tree
//!
//! The Sommer building model needs two numbers per link: how many exterior walls the
//! straight path crosses, and how many metres of it lie inside buildings. Both come from
//! a spatial index over the world's building footprints — 7,390 of them in the Manhattan
//! import — because testing every footprint against every link is quadratic in the wrong
//! variables.
//!
//! `v2xw-world` builds exactly such an index (`WorldIndex`, an `rstar` R-tree of
//! footprint envelopes, with `buildings_on_segment` and `wall_crossings` on it), but the
//! type and `World::index()` are both `pub(crate)`, so nothing outside that crate can
//! reach them. This module therefore builds the same tree over the public
//! `World::buildings` field with the same `rstar` crate, caches it per world (keyed by the
//! world's `content_hash`, which is what makes the cache safe: a different world is a
//! different hash) and reproduces the same two primitives. The change that would remove
//! this duplication is three lines in `v2xw-world` — a public accessor for the index or
//! for the two queries — and the card records it as a limitation rather than pretending
//! the duplication is a design choice.
//!
//! Determinism: every query sorts its results by [`BuildingId`] before returning, exactly
//! as `v2xw-world`'s own index does, so an R-tree traversal order can never reach a loss
//! value.
