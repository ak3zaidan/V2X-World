//! Medium access: `mac/80211p/edca-ocb` (04-models.md §4.3) and
//! `mac/80211p/slotted-abstraction` (§4.9), with the CBR measurement of §4.5.
//!
//! # OCB is why this state machine is small
//!
//! In outside-the-context-of-a-BSS mode there is no association, no ACK for a
//! group-addressed frame, and therefore **no retransmission and no contention-window
//! doubling**: EN 302 663 Annex C.4.2's note says it outright — "in broadcast mode the
//! backoff procedure is only invoked once during the initial listening (AIFS) ... due to
//! the lack of ACKs in broadcast transmissions. Therefore CW is always CWmin and never
//! doubled." A CAM, a BSM and a DENM are all group-addressed, so for the traffic this
//! simulator exists to study the retry logic is dead code. [`EdcaOcbMac`] implements that
//! literally: a broadcast frame is granted once, and
//! `a_broadcast_frame_is_never_retransmitted` asserts that no path re-enqueues it and that
//! `CW` never leaves `CWmin`.
//!
//! # Being driven rather than driving
//!
//! The published `Mac` has the MAC schedule its own `MacTimer` events, which needs the
//! engine's payload enum (build decision D8). [`crate::traits::Mac::poll`] is the seam
//! instead: the engine calls it from the timer handler it owns, and a test calls it
//! directly with a clock it sets by hand — which is what makes the backoff freeze, the
//! AIFS wait and the internal-collision rule testable without a kernel.
//!
//! Being driven does not mean the engine decides *when*. [`crate::traits::Mac::next_poll_at`]
//! reports the instant the earliest backoff expires, so the engine schedules its timer
//! for the slot boundary the MAC computed and [`crate::types::TxGrant::at`] is that
//! instant rather than whenever the poll happened. Without it the poll cadence sets the
//! collision structure instead of the 13 µs slot.
//!
//! # A queue drains
//!
//! `enqueue` arms an access category's backoff when none is pending; a grant re-arms it
//! whenever the queue is still non-empty, one AIFS after the granted frame's air time.
//! That is what makes the queue drain. It is also the only re-arm: there is still no
//! retransmission and no contention-window doubling, because there is still no ACK.
//!
//! # The CBR window
//!
//! [`CbrMeter`] accumulates busy intervals and reports `T_busy / T_CBR` over the last
//! 100 ms [EN 302 571 §4.2.10.1]. Busy means the received signal strength exceeded
//! −85 dBm, which is the PHY's [`crate::phy::CcaConfig::busy_dbm`]; the node's own
//! transmissions count as busy too, because the medium is occupied and because every
//! simulator this is compared against counts them (recorded on the card, since the
//! standard defines the measurement on receive).
