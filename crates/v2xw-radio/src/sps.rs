//! `mac/lte-v2x/sps-sensing` and `mac/nr-v2x/sps-sensing` — the sensing-based
//! semi-persistent scheduler both sidelinks use (04-models.md §5.1 steps 1-7, §5.2).
//!
//! One engine, two parameter sets, exactly as 04-models.md §5 asks: "Mode 4 and Mode 2
//! share one parameterized sensing and SPS engine (sensing window, selection window, RSRP
//! exclusion with 3 dB step-up until a candidate percentage survives, S-RSSI ranking,
//! random pick, reservation with probabilistic keep); Mode 2 adds re-evaluation,
//! pre-emption, PSFCH feedback and numerology."
//!
//! # The seven steps, and where each lives
//!
//! | Step (04-models.md §5.1) | Here |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1. Sensing window: the last 1,000 subframes | [`SensingHistory`], a ring over the window |
//! | 2. Selection window `[n + T1, n + T2]` | [`SpsParams::t1_slots`], [`SpsParams::t2_slots`] |
//! | 3. RSRP exclusion, and exclusion of unmonitored slots | [`SpsEngine::exclude`] |
//! | 4. 3 dB step-up until the candidate percentage survives | [`SpsEngine::select`] |
//! | 5. S-RSSI ranking, keep the lowest 20 %, uniform pick | [`SpsEngine::select`] |
//! | 6. Reserve for `C_resel`, keep with `probResourceKeep` | [`Reservation`], [`SpsEngine::on_transmitted`] |
//! | 7. HARQ: blind retransmission inside the SCI's time gap | [`SpsParams::max_transmissions`] |
//!
//! # Why the history is a ring and not a map
//!
//! The sensing window is 1,000 subframes wide and a dense highway puts a few thousand
//! SCIs into it per UE. A `BTreeMap` keyed by `(slot, sub-channel)` would hold one entry
//! per sensed SCI per UE for the whole window — at the 120 veh/km validation density that
//! is millions of live entries — and the exclusion pass would walk all of them. The ring
//! is `window_slots × sub-channels` cells, indexed arithmetically, each holding the
//! *strongest* SCI sensed on that resource and the linear S-RSSI. It is O(1) to update,
//! `O(window × sub-channels)` to scan, bounded in memory, and — because it is a `Vec`
//! indexed by arithmetic rather than a hash map — it cannot leak an iteration order into
//! a selection (the crate's fourth property).
//!
//! Keeping only the strongest SCI per resource is a real approximation and the card says
//! so: two UEs reserving the same resource from different distances are sensed as one.
//! The consequence is confined to the exclusion test, which compares against a threshold
//! that the stronger of the two decides anyway.
//!
//! # What the engine does not decide
//!
//! It does not decide *what* was sensed. Whether a UE could decode a particular SCI is
//! the PHY's answer ([`crate::cv2x`]), and the engine is told through
//! [`SpsEngine::note_sensed`] and [`SpsEngine::note_energy`]. That split is invariant
//! I-T2's shape at the radio layer: a UE schedules against what it heard, never against
//! what was transmitted.
