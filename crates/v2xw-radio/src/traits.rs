//! The six plug-in seams of 03-interfaces.md §4: [`Propagation`], [`Fading`],
//! [`ObstacleModel`], [`Phy`], [`Mac`] and [`Dcc`].
//!
//! # Why every trait is generic over the context
//!
//! [`v2xw_core::ctx::Ctx`] carries three associated types — the world, the actor index
//! and the engine's event payload enum — so `&mut dyn Ctx` on its own does not name a
//! type. Each trait here therefore takes the context as a type parameter, exactly as
//! `v2xw_msg::generator::MessageGenerator` does. Once the engine fixes the three,
//! `dyn Phy<EngineCtx>` is an ordinary trait object, which is how in-process plug-ins are
//! called (ADR 0007 §8). Every implementation in this crate is written against `C: Ctx`
//! with no further bound, so a caller can supply any context: the engine's, or a test's.
//!
//! # Four deliberate divergences from the published signatures
//!
//! Each one is here because the published shape cannot be written yet, not because it is
//! inconvenient, and each is a one-line change if the engine decides otherwise.
//!
//! 1. **`begin_tx` returns the deadline instead of scheduling it.** 03-interfaces.md §4
//!    says `begin_tx` "schedules `end_tx`". A model cannot: `Ctx::schedule` takes a
//!    `Self::Payload`, and the concrete event enum lives in the engine crate (build
//!    decision D8), so no code here can construct one. [`Phy::begin_tx`] therefore
//!    computes the air time and returns a [`TxHandle`] carrying `end`, and the engine
//!    schedules the [`v2xw_core::event::EventClass::PhyEnd`] event for that instant. The
//!    message layer resolved the same problem the same way (a generator returns
//!    `GenRequest`s rather than scheduling them).
//! 2. **`begin_tx` returns a `Result`.** 04-models.md §4.6 requires it to reject a frame
//!    above the MSDU cap, which a signature returning `TxHandle` cannot express.
//! 3. **`Propagation::loss_db` takes `&mut self`.** The spatially correlated shadowing of
//!    04-models.md §3.2 is an AR(1) process with per-link state, and the TR 37.885 link
//!    state machine is re-evaluated every 100 ms; both mutate. `&self` would force
//!    interior mutability on a type the registry requires to be `Sync`, which is the
//!    shape ADR 0004 exists to keep out of the engine.
//! 4. **`Mac::cbr` takes the instant to measure at.** The channel busy ratio is busy time
//!    over the last `T_CBR` *ending somewhere*, and a MAC holds no clock. Without the
//!    parameter the only instant available is whenever the meter was last told something,
//!    so a node whose channel has fallen quiet reports the load it had when it was last
//!    busy and never decays. See [`Mac::cbr`].
//!
