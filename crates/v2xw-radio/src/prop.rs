//! Large-scale propagation: `propagation/free-space`, `propagation/two-ray-ground`,
//! `propagation/log-distance-shadowing` and `propagation/tr37885`
//! (04-models.md §3.1-§3.3, §3.6).
//!
//! Every model here returns the full [`LossBreakdown`] so the inspector can show each
//! term, and every constant carries its citation in the model card. The carrier is
//! 5.9 GHz (λ ≈ 0.0508 m); the 3GPP evaluation model uses its own `fc` and the TRs use
//! 6 GHz as a proxy.
//!
//! # The three parts of a loss
//!
//! * **Deterministic distance law.** Friis, the two-ray asymptote, the dual-slope
//!   log-distance law, or one of the TR 37.885 state formulas.
//! * **Shadowing.** A log-normal realisation that is *spatially correlated*: it is an
//!   AR(1) process over distance moved, per link, so a vehicle driving through a shadow
//!   stays in it for a decorrelation distance instead of re-rolling a fresh number every
//!   frame. This is [`ShadowProcess`], and it is the reason
//!   [`crate::traits::Propagation::loss_db`] takes `&mut self`.
//! * **Terms the other families own.** Obstacle shadowing (the [`crate::obstacle`]
//!   models), fast fading ([`crate::fading`]) and the antenna gains. The building term is
//!   an exception: the Sommer formula is deterministic in the geometry the
//!   [`LosResult`] already carries, so a propagation model can include it directly, which
//!   is what 04-models.md §3.5 means by "`ObstacleModel` **+ Propagation term**".
//!
//! # Presets, and the ones that are not here
//!
//! The Abbas 2015 dual-slope LOS and OLOS rows are shipped as defaults with every
//! constant printed in 04-models.md §3.2. The Kunisch and Cheng rows are shipped with the
//! constants the table prints and `todo-calibrate` stand-ins for the ones it marks
//! UNVERIFIED or leaves blank, and they register `validation.status = unvalidated`, which
//! is the registry rule the design document states for them. Two rows are **not** shipped
//! at all, because shipping them would mean inventing their numbers:
//!
//! * `karedal-*` — "numeric grid UNVERIFIED (extraction failed on three copies); **not
//!   shippable until read**" (§3.2). Nothing but the qualitative statement `n < 2` is
//!   available.
//! * `abbas-nlos-intersection` — the table gives the exponent 2.69 and σ 4.1 but no
//!   `PL0`, and the row is a reference to the Mangel NLOS-intersection model, a different
//!   functional form from the dual-slope law implemented here. A building-obstructed link
//!   is served by `propagation/tr37885`'s NLOS formula or by the Sommer building term on
//!   top of a LOS law.
//! * `two-ray-interference` — its ground permittivity ε_r is UNVERIFIED (not in cache).
//!
//! `propagation/winner-plus-b1` is likewise absent: 04-models.md §3.3 records that all of
//! its coefficients are `TODO: calibrate` because WINNER II D1.1.2 is not cached.
