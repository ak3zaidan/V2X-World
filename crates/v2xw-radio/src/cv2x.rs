//! `phy/lte-v2x/mode4` and `phy/nr-v2x/mode2` — the sidelink physical layer
//! (04-models.md §5.1, §5.2, tiers in §5.4).
//!
//! The reception chain 04-models.md §5.1 specifies for `medium` and `high`, in order:
//!
//! 1. **Half duplex.** A UE that transmitted in the slot heard nothing in it. In LTE this
//!    is unconditional; in NR it is the same, since a Mode 2 UE has one transceiver.
//!    Reported [`LossCause::HalfDuplex`].
//! 2. **Sensitivity.** Below −90.4 dBm nothing is detected
//!    [TS 36.101 v14.4.0 via 04-models.md §5.1]. Reported
//!    [`LossCause::BelowSensitivity`].
//! 3. **SINR per sub-channel**, with the interferer sum including in-band emissions from
//!    co-slot transmitters on *other* sub-channels through the `K_IBE` mask
//!    ([`crate::sidelink::IbeMask`]).
//! 4. **SCI decoding first.** The control channel is decoded before the transport block,
//!    and an SCI failure loses the transport block. When the collision is a same-resource
//!    reservation — two UEs that picked the same `(slot, sub-channel)` — the loss is
//!    [`LossCause::ResourceCollision`] rather than a plain collision, which is what makes
//!    the SPS failure mode visible in the accounting.
//! 5. **The LUT draw** ([`crate::bler`]).
//!
//! # Why this is not [`crate::phy::OfdmPhy`] with different constants
//!
//! Three differences go all the way down. Air time does not depend on the packet size: a
//! transport block occupies exactly one subframe or slot whatever it carries, and the
//! size decides how many *sub-channels* it takes instead ([`SidelinkPhy::air_time`]).
//! There is no carrier sense, so there is no clear-channel assessment driving access and
//! no capture threshold — a receiver is not "locked" to a preamble. And the interference
//! sum is structured by frequency: two co-slot transmissions on disjoint sub-channels
//! interfere only through the emission mask, which has no 802.11p counterpart.
//!
//! # The four loss causes, and the decomposition they have to reproduce
//!
//! 04-models.md §13's "C-V2X loss decomposition" row requires the per-cause accounting to
//! decompose as Gonzalez-Martin's `PDR = 1 − (P_HD + P_SEN + P_PRO + P_COL)`. The mapping
//! is exact and is asserted by `every_loss_lands_in_the_gonzalez_martin_decomposition`:
//! `P_HD` is [`LossCause::HalfDuplex`], `P_SEN` is [`LossCause::BelowSensitivity`],
//! `P_PRO` is [`LossCause::Fading`] (a failure with no interferer present: propagation and
//! noise alone) and `P_COL` is the three interference causes together.
