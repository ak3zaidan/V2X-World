//! The measurement harness: a self-contained highway that drives one radio stack and
//! reports packet delivery against distance, so the curves of 04-models.md §13 can be
//! checked rather than asserted.
//!
//! # Why a harness and not a scenario
//!
//! The validation rows of 04-models.md §13 are statements about *curves*: "PDR ≈ 0.97 at
//! 0 m, 0.95 at 100 m, 0.90 at 200 m …". Checking one needs tens of thousands of
//! transmissions and millions of reception evaluations at a controlled vehicle density,
//! and it needs the *same* world for every radio so that a comparison between
//! technologies is a comparison of radios. The engine can run that scenario once it
//! exists; this harness runs it now, from inside the crate that owns the models, with
//! nothing between the models and the statistic.
//!
//! Everything it adds beyond the models is geometry and bookkeeping: a ring highway with
//! wrap-around (Todisco's own layout), constant-speed vehicles in two directions, a
//! packet generator, and a distance-binned counter. There is no propagation, PHY, MAC or
//! error model here — those are [`crate::prop`], [`crate::cv2x`], [`crate::sps`],
//! [`crate::bler`], [`crate::phy`] and [`crate::mac`], driven through their own published
//! interfaces.
//!
//! # The one thing the harness has to be honest about
//!
//! **The published curves were produced with WINNER+ B1, which this workspace does not
//! ship.** 04-models.md §3.3 registers `propagation/winner-plus-b1` with "every
//! coefficient `TODO: calibrate`" because the WINNER II D1.1.2 report is not in the cache,
//! and says in as many words that "validation runs that follow Molina-Masegosa, Bazzi or
//! Todisco (§13) need it". The harness therefore offers two channels
//! ([`ChannelModel`]): the fully cited TR 37.885 highway-LOS model that *is* shipped, and
//! a dual-slope stand-in whose coefficients are `todo-calibrate` and which exists only so
//! that the size of the resulting disagreement can be measured rather than guessed. Every
//! report says which channel produced it, and
//! [`SweepReport::channel_disclaimer`] carries the sentence into any output.
