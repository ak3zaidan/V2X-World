//! `v2xw-radio` — propagation, fading, obstacle shadowing, the IEEE 802.11p, LTE-V2X and
//! NR-V2X PHY and MAC layers, the cellular Uu link, decentralised congestion control and
//! channel accounting.
//!
//! This is the crate that turns geometry into decibels and decibels into frame outcomes.
//! It holds the six plug-in families of 03-interfaces.md §4 ([`traits`]) and the models
//! 04-models.md §3, §4 and §6 specify, with every cited constant carrying its clause in
//! the code and in its model card.
//!
//! It never touches message semantics, node behaviour or security: a frame is a length, an
//! MCS and an access category here, and what it carries is [`v2xw-msg`]'s business
//! (02-architecture.md §2, ADR 0010).

//! # The four properties this crate is built to keep
//!
//! **1. No platform transcendental.** Every `exp`, `log10`, `pow`, `sqrt` and `sin_cos`
//! comes from [`v2xw_core::math`]. The one function this crate needs that the contract
//! crate does not re-export is the error function, and [`numeric`] reaches for the *same*
//! pure-Rust `libm` crate directly and says why in its own documentation. There is no call
//! to `f64::exp` or its siblings anywhere here.
//!
//! **2. Every draw from a keyed stream.** The shadowing innovation comes from
//! `(Shadow, Link)`, the fading sample from `(Fading, LinkFrame)`, the backoff from
//! `(MacBackoff, Node)`, the abstract reception from `(AbstractRx, LinkFrame)` and the
//! frame error from `(plugin(phy id), LinkFrame)`. No model holds a generator, so one
//! model's draws never depend on what another model did or on the order receivers were
//! evaluated in — which is invariant I-R2, and what makes the phase-parallel receiver map
//! of 02-architecture.md §6.4 legitimate.
//!
//! **3. Ordered reductions.** Interference sums go through
//! [`numeric::sum_powers_mw`], which sorts by [`v2xw_core::ids::NodeId`] before reducing
//! with [`v2xw_core::math::sum_ordered`]. Floating-point addition is not associative, and
//! a SINR one bit apart can land on either side of a PER threshold.
//!
//! **4. No `HashMap` reaching an output.** Per-link, per-node and per-arrival state lives
//! in `BTreeMap`s keyed by dense integers, so a dump, a digest or an iteration order is
//! the same on every run and every platform.
//!
//! # What "cited" means here, and where it stops
//!
//! Every default carries a [`v2xw_core::card::Source`]. Where 04-models.md marks a
//! constant UNVERIFIED or does not print it, this crate does one of three things and says
//! which:
//!
//! * ships the value with `SourceKind::TodoCalibrate` and a calibration plan, and
//!   registers the model `unvalidated` — the Cheng and Kunisch path-loss presets, the Yin
//!   fading preset's two `m` values, the J2945/1 tracking-error sensitivity, the Sommer
//!   material mapping, the borrowed near slope of `abbas-olos-highway`;
//! * **does not ship the model at all** — the `karedal-*` presets ("not shippable until
//!   read"), `abbas-nlos-intersection` (no `PL0`, and a different functional form),
//!   `fading/taliwal-ns2` ("not shipped until confirmed"), `two-ray-interference`
//!   (UNVERIFIED ground permittivity), `propagation/winner-plus-b1` (every coefficient
//!   `TODO: calibrate`), `fading/rician` (no cited K for 5.9 GHz V2V);
//! * or, where a standard's printed equation looked wrong, re-reads it until it is not.
//!   The EN 302 571 / TS 103 175 idle-time bound was carried here for a while as a
//!   documented disagreement with the standard, with a unit parameter and an
//!   "unexplained 2 % residual" built on top of it; it was a misplaced parenthesis, and
//!   the correct grouping reproduces both of the standard's worked examples to 0.01 %
//!   ([`dcc`]).
//!
//! # Three divergences from the published signatures
//!
//! [`traits`] documents them in full: `begin_tx` returns the transmission's deadline
//! instead of scheduling it and returns a `Result` so it can refuse an oversized frame,
//! `Propagation::loss_db` takes `&mut self` because correlated shadowing is per-link
//! state, and `Mac` has a `poll` so the engine can drive the access state machine without
//! the MAC constructing event payloads it cannot name. All three exist because the event
//! payload enum lives in the engine crate (build decision D8), and all three are one line
//! to change once it exists.
