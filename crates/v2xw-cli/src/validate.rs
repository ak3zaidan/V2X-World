//! `v2xw validate` — load a scenario, check it, and say what is wrong in the author's
//! terms.
//!
//! 03-interfaces.md §13 asks for errors that name the field and the conflict rather than a
//! line number and a serde message, and the engine's [`v2xw_engine::ScenarioError`] is
//! already that shape. This command's whole job is to print it without flattening it, and
//! to say what the merge produced, because the commonest surprise in a scenario with a
//! `meta.base` is a key the author believes they overrode and did not.
//!
//! Validation does **not** build the world. `v2xw validate` on a scenario naming a
//! 30 MB OSM extract is instant, and that is the point: it is the check an author runs on
//! every edit. It notes a map or terrain file the scenario names that is not there from the
//! current directory (`v2xw_engine::scenario::preflight`), without reading it. Whether the
//! world can be built is what `v2xw run` finds out.
