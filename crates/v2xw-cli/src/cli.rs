//! The argument grammar.
//!
//! `clap` with derive is already a workspace dependency (the Phase 0 asset survey resolved
//! it), so no second argument parser is introduced here.
//!
//! Two conventions are followed throughout, both taken from the scenario schema:
//! units live in flag names (`--keyframe-ms`, `--duration-s`), and a flag that overrides a
//! scenario field is spelled `--<field>` and says in its help that it changes the scenario
//! hash — because it does, and a sweep whose runs all report one hash would be worthless.
