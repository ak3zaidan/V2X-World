//! `v2xw import-osm` — import an OpenStreetMap extract into the three world formats.
//!
//! # The speed preset has no default, and this command does not invent one
//!
//! [`v2xw_world::osm::OsmOptions::highway_preset`] is required: the fallback speed of a
//! road class is a jurisdictional fact, and the importer refuses rather than shipping one
//! jurisdiction's table to every caller. `--speed-preset` is therefore a real choice the
//! operator makes, and the preset's own citation is printed next to it so that the choice
//! is on the record before the world is written.
//!
//! # The bounding box also fixes the world frame
//!
//! `--bbox` is not only a filter. [`v2xw_world::osm::OsmOptions::bbox`] makes the box's
//! south-west corner the world's origin, so a box stated here and the same box stated in a
//! scenario produce the same metre coordinates, and re-fetching the extract at a wider
//! radius cannot move a single one. Left out, the frame comes from the extract's own
//! bounds, which is what the importer's report calls `origin from the extract-bounds`.
//!
//! The four numbers are in the order the design documents write them —
//! `min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat` — because that is the order D7 states the Phase 1 box
//! in.
//!
//! **A range check cannot catch a transposed Manhattan box.** `40.744,-73.99,...` is a
//! perfectly legal longitude followed by a perfectly legal latitude: −73.99° is a real
//! place in the Southern Ocean. Measured, that box imports without complaint and produces
//! a world of `extent 0 x 0 m`, 0 drivable lanes and 488 `clipped-out` anomalies — the
//! importer returns `Ok`, because an empty world is not a malformed one. The order check
//! below therefore rejects only what is out of range, and the real guard is
//! [`refuse_an_empty_network`], which looks at what came out: an import with no drivable
//! lane is refused, naming the box, the extract's own bounds and the argument order.
//!
//! # The import date is an argument
//!
//! `--imported-at` fills [`v2xw_world::ImportOptions::imported_at`]. Left out, it comes
//! from [`crate::wall::now_iso8601_utc`] — the caller's clock, which is the only place in
//! this workspace that one may be read. It is excluded from the world's content hash, so
//! two imports of one extract on two days produce the same `world_hash`.
