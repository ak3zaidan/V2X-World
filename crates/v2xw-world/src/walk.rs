//! Pedestrian infrastructure: crosswalks, where they cut the vehicle lanes, and the
//! pedestrian signal intervals of a signalised junction.
//!
//! # Crosswalks
//!
//! A crosswalk is carried as one or more [`LaneKind::Crossing`] lanes — one per walking
//! direction — so a pedestrian routes over it like any other walkable lane. [`crosswalks`]
//! groups the lanes that are the same painted crosswalk (the two directions of one
//! `footway=crossing` way, or of one generated crossing), and [`crosswalk_conflicts`] finds
//! where each crosswalk cuts a lane a vehicle or a cyclist drives: the stretch of that
//! lane the crosswalk band covers. The mobility model yields at those stretches and the
//! traffic auditor checks them, and both read this one geometry.
//!
//! # Pedestrian signal intervals (MUTCD 2009 §4E.06)
//!
//! A signalised crosswalk shows WALKING PERSON (walk), flashing UPRAISED HAND (the
//! pedestrian change interval, "flashing don't walk") and steady UPRAISED HAND (don't
//! walk). [`signalise_crossings`] adds these to a junction's plan **alongside** the vehicle
//! phases, without changing any vehicle state:
//!
//! * The crosswalk may show walk only while no vehicle movement that cuts it has a
//!   protected indication: a straight-through movement on anything but red, or a left
//!   turn on a protected (non-yielding) green. Turning movements on a permissive green
//!   keep their green and **yield** to pedestrians in the crosswalk — UVC §11-202(a)1
//!   ("shall yield the right of way ... to pedestrians lawfully within ... an adjacent
//!   crosswalk"), which the mobility model enforces — so they do not stop the walk. This is
//!   the concurrent pedestrian phasing of MUTCD §4E.06 and of `netconvert`'s generated
//!   crossings.
//! * Walk starts with the first green inside that window (not during an all-red that ends
//!   the conflicting phase).
//! * The pedestrian clearance time is the crossing length at **3.5 ft/s (1.07 m/s)**,
//!   MUTCD 2009 §4E.06 ¶07. The crossing length is the crosswalk lane's own length, kerb
//!   to kerb (a little longer than the travelled way, so conservative).
//! * The pedestrian change interval is followed by a **buffer interval of at least 3 s**
//!   of steady don't-walk before any conflicting vehicle is released (MUTCD 2009 §4E.06
//!   ¶¶13-15); it may overlap the vehicle change and clearance intervals, which is where it
//!   falls here.
//! * The walk interval should be at least **7 s**, and may be as short as **4 s** where
//!   pedestrian volumes and characteristics do not need 7 s (MUTCD 2009 §4E.06 ¶¶04-05).
//!   The vehicle split is not this module's to change, so a window too short for both is
//!   *reported* rather than hidden: a walk between 4 s and 7 s is counted as
//!   [`PedestrianSignalReport::short_walk`], and a window that cannot hold 4 s of walk and
//!   the full clearance is given 4 s of walk with a clearance shorter than the MUTCD value
//!   and counted as [`PedestrianSignalReport::short_clearance`].
//!
//! The pedestrian indications are encoded in the plan's own state vector: walk is
//! [`SignalState::Green`], the pedestrian change interval is [`SignalState::Amber`] and
//! don't-walk is [`SignalState::Red`]. That is also how SAE J2735 carries a pedestrian
//! signal group in SPaT (walk = protected-Movement-Allowed, flashing don't walk =
//! protected-clearance, don't walk = stop-And-Remain), so a SPaT encoder that maps a
//! vehicle movement's states maps a crosswalk's correctly with no special case. Each
//! crosswalk gets its own signal group, numbered from [`PEDESTRIAN_GROUP_BASE`], and a
//! [`SignalHeadKind::Pedestrian`] head at each end.
//!
//! **Paragraph numbers.** The ¶ numbers above are from the 2009 edition as revised in
//! 2012; the values (3.5 ft/s, 7 s, 4 s, 3 s) are the ones the text states, and the card
//! records the edition. The 2023 11th edition keeps the same values.
