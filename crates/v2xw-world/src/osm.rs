//! `world/source/osm` — the native OpenStreetMap importer (04-models.md §1.2).
//!
//! Reads an OSM XML extract and produces a lane-level [`World`]: a drivable graph with
//! per-lane centrelines, junction areas, internal connectors, conflict matrices and turn
//! restrictions; a pedestrian and cycle graph in the same lane list that no motor vehicle
//! may enter; buildings with sourced heights; land-use zones; synthesised fixed-time
//! signal plans; and a provenance record naming every transformation applied.
//!
//! **Nothing in this module is specific to any city** (D7). Manhattan is the Phase 1
//! world, but it appears only in the tests and in the scenario file; the code reads tags,
//! not place names.
//!
//! # The pipeline
//!
//! | Stage | What it does | Where |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1. parse | one streaming pass over the XML, no DOM | [`parse_osm`] |
//! | 2. classify | `highway`, `access`, `oneway`, `lanes`, `maxspeed`, `turn:lanes` → a [`WayPlan`] per way | [`classify_way`] |
//! | 3. project | geodetic → local ENU metres, origin at the south-west corner of the kept geometry (D6) | `Projection` |
//! | 4. split | ways cut at nodes shared by two or more ways of the same family; interior shape nodes stay as geometry | `split_ways` |
//! | 5. collapse | chains of segments through a trivial two-road node merged back into one segment | `collapse_trivial_junctions` |
//! | 6. lay out | lanes offset left to right from the way centreline, trimmed back at each junction | `build_network` |
//! | 7. connect | junction areas, internal connectors, turn directions, conflict matrices, `restriction` relations | `build_movements`, `apply_restrictions` |
//! | 8. signalise | `highway=traffic_signals` nodes → fixed-time plans with the 04-models.md §2.3 defaults | `synthesise_signals` |
//! | 9. buildings, land use, crossings | rings, holes, heights with their [`HeightSource`] | `build_buildings`, `build_landuse` |
//! | 10. record | provenance, licence, attribution, content hash | [`import_osm`] |
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! The osm2streets simplification list (04-models.md §1.2) has four entries. This
//! importer implements **the trivial two-road junction collapse** (stage 5), which is the
//! one that matters most on real data because OSM splits a single street into many ways
//! at every attribute change. The other three — dual-carriageway "sausage link" merging,
//! dog-leg junction merging and parallel footway snapping — are **not** implemented; they
//! are counted as deliberate omissions in [`ImportReport::skipped_simplifications`] and
//! recorded in the provenance, because a simplification that silently did not run would
//! be indistinguishable from one that ran and found nothing.
//!
//! Terrain is flat at `z = 0` in Phase 1. [`OsmOptions::terrain`] is the hook a DEM
//! importer fills (04-models.md §1.4); when it is `None` the provenance says so.
//!
//! # Robustness
//!
//! Real extracts contain ways with one node, ways referencing nodes the extract does not
//! carry, `maxspeed=signals`, `height=12;15`, unclosed multipolygon rings and footprints
//! that self-intersect. None of these may panic or abort the import: every one is counted
//! in an [`ImportReport`] by [`Anomaly`] category, with a few example OSM ids, and the
//! import continues. The report is returned beside the world.

/// 2. The turn direction is the geometry's: the heading change from the approach lane's
///    end to the departure lane's start, banded by [`TurnDirection::from_heading_change`].
/// 3. `turn:lanes`, where the way carries a usable one, decides which lanes may make which
///    movement ([`turn_matches`]). Where it does not, the geometric rule applies: right
///    turns from the rightmost lane, left turns and U-turns from the leftmost, everything
///    else from any lane ([`lanes_for_turn`]).
/// 4. **At a fork** — two or more departures that are all "straight on" from one approach
///    — the approach lanes that could take any of them are shared out in order: the
///    rightmost lanes to the rightmost branch, in proportion to each branch's lane count
///    ([`fork_assignment`]). Letting every lane take every branch crossed the lane paths
///    inside the junction (lane 0 to the left branch while lane 3 went to the right one),
///    and because both are "straight" the signal plan gave the crossing pair the same
///    protected green: 19 conflicting greens on the Manhattan extract.
/// 5. Any approach lane left with no movement at all is given the straightest candidate,
///    so that a lane is never a dead end because of a tag.
/// 6. **Room to turn.** Every movement's approach lane end and departure lane start are
///    pulled back from the junction, as far as needed and as far as the lanes allow, until
///    the arc between them can have the design radius [`TURN_DESIGN_RADIUS_M`]
///    ([`pull_back_for_turns`]). Only then are the connectors built.
///
/// A movement whose two lane ends are within a millimetre of each other — which happens
/// when a segment was too short to trim — gets no connector lane, because [`Lane::new`]
/// refuses a sub-millimetre segment. It is returned as a [`DirectMovement`] so that the

/// # What the fold loses, and why it is a simplification rather than a fix

/// The parts' own **geometry** is not kept: [`Building`] has no field for a sub-volume,

/// (§4.4), and nothing downstream reads one yet. So a stepped tower is a single prism as
/// tall as its tallest part, not a stack of volumes, and an obstacle model sees more
/// mass at high altitude than the structure really has — the setback above a podium is
/// filled in. That is a deliberate simplification, it is on the model card as
/// `building_parts_as_max_height`, and reversing it means adding a parts list to
/// [`Building`], a `min_height_m` column to the wire format and a stacked-prism obstacle
/// model to go with them.
///
/// It is the right way round for a propagation study all the same: the old behaviour

/// # The ladder, and the case that forces each rung
///
/// 1. **The outline that shares the most footprint with the part.** Nearly every
///    contested part is settled here: part 261243304 is 1.0000 inside One United Nations
///    Plaza and 0.8533 inside the roof next door, and part 291189626 is 1.0000 inside
///    the Helmsley Building and 0.9553 inside the market hall in its concourse. A part
///    that hangs over the edge of a candidate is not a subdivision of it.
///
/// 2. **Where several outlines contain the whole part ([`PART_INSIDE_MIN`]), the
///    innermost one** — the candidate nested inside all the others. The United Nations
///    Secretariat Building's outline (1 920 m²) is drawn wholly inside the United
///    Nations Headquarters outline (16 441 m², the whole campus), and the Secretariat's
///    two parts are 1.0000 inside both. They are the Secretariat's: the campus outline
///    is the site, the Secretariat outline is the building on it, and taking the campus
///    would stand a 156 m prism on 16 441 m² of lawn and river frontage. Nesting decides
///    this one and area cannot — area would pick the campus, and the smallest-area rule
///    that this replaces happened to pick the Secretariat for the same reason it picked
///    the wrong parent elsewhere.
///
/// 3. **Otherwise, the outline that is already subdivided into parts.** Two named cases
///    reach this rung and nothing else in the extract does. Part 1473999184 (24 m²,
///    155 m, starting 60 m up) is 1.0000 inside both Rose Hill (905 m²) and the 156 m²
///    building beside it, because those two footprints overlap in a 23.8 m² sliver and
///    the part *is* that sliver: it is the tower's overhang over its neighbour's lot,
///    drawn on the neighbour's own nodes. Neither outline is nested in the other — they
///    share 2.6% and 15.2% of themselves — so rung 2 says nothing. What separates them
///    is that Rose Hill is mapped part by part (seven parts of its own, no other
///    claimant) and the neighbour is a plain 25.2 m footprint with no parts at all: a
///    structure that is not subdivided has no subdivisions, so the sliver is Rose Hill's.
///    Part 283472143 is the same shape of case at 785 Eighth Avenue (four parts of its
///    own) against a three-storey neighbour with none.
///
/// 4. **Ascending candidate index**, which is ascending OSM way id and then ascending
///    OSM relation id — the order pass 1 builds candidates in. Nothing in the extract
///    reaches this rung; it is here so that the answer can never depend on iteration
///    order (crate rule 2), and [`OutlineIndex::candidates_over`] hands the claims over
///    in that order for the same reason.
///
/// # What it does not look at
///
/// Interior holes. [`Outline`] carries outer rings only, so a part standing in a
/// courtyard counts as inside the outline around the courtyard, exactly as it did under
/// the point test. Folding it in is also the conservative answer for an obstacle model:
/// it raises an existing structure rather than inventing a free-standing one.
///
/// Tags, too — heights especially. The wrong parents all had a tagged height far below
/// the part's, so "a part may not be taller than its parent says it is" would also have
/// caught them, but it would be wrong in general: Midtown is mapped part-first and the
/// Chrysler Building's outline carries no height at all, which is exactly why the fold
/// exists.
