//! A run: the engine behind a lock, the world bytes, and the step stream every connection
//! reads from.
//!
//! One [`Run`] per engine process, which is what §1.1's "one WebSocket endpoint per engine
//! process" implies. The engine is stepped from exactly one place at a time — the producer
//! task while the run is advancing, the RPC dispatcher while it is paused — and the lock
//! makes that a compile-time-checked fact rather than a convention.
//!
//! # The stream is a broadcast of state, not of frames
//!
//! Every connection gets its own [`tokio::sync::broadcast`] subscription to
//! [`crate::engine::StepOutput`] and encodes its own frames from it. That is not an
//! optimisation, it is a requirement: profile blanking happens at the producer (§5.3), and
//! `Telemetry` and `Event` frames carry only what the connection subscribed to (§6.7,
//! §6.12), so there is no single frame that would be correct for two connections.
//!
//! The channel is bounded. A connection that falls far enough behind gets a
//! `RecvError::Lagged`, which the transport turns into exactly what §1.5 prescribes for a
//! drop: a resync keyframe and a `stream.drop` notification.
