//! The seam between this crate and the simulation engine.
//!
//! This trait is defined here, in the transport, rather than in `v2xw-engine`, because
//! what the transport needs is *state per mobility step* and what the kernel offers is a
//! run loop and a record stream. There are three implementations in-tree:
//!
//! * [`crate::live::LiveEngine`] — a real `v2xw-engine` run (build decision D8). This is
//!   the one that matters; the other two exist around it.
//! * [`crate::stub::StubEngine`] — a deterministic synthetic run on a procedurally
//!   generated grid world, kept because it is what lets the framing and session tests run
//!   without importing a city, and because it is the fixture a client developer can point
//!   at with no scenario at all.
//! * [`crate::replay::ReplayEngine`] — a run served from an MCAP recording through
//!   `v2xw-record`'s reader, which is the replay mode of §7.
//!
//! Nothing in [`crate::session`], [`crate::rpc`] or [`crate::http`] refers to any of them
//! by name.
//!
//! # Why the engine hands over state and not frames
//!
//! A connection's stream depends on the connection: its profile blanks ground-truth
//! columns at the producer (§5.3), its `view.follow` subscription decides which nodes are
//! in a `Telemetry` frame (§6.7), and its `events.set` subscription decides which channels
//! are in an `Event` frame (§6.12). The engine therefore produces *state* — one
//! [`StepOutput`] per mobility step, ground truth included — and the session encodes the
//! frames it is allowed to send. There is one encoder, `v2xw-record`'s, on both paths.
//!
//! # No wall clock
//!
//! Nothing in this trait reads a clock. [`Engine::step`] advances by exactly one mobility
//! step of simulated time whenever it is called; how often it is called is the transport's
//! business, and the transport is the only place in this crate that looks at wall time
//! (§1.5's pacing, §1.2's ping interval).
