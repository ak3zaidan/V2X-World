//! The real engine behind the [`crate::engine::Engine`] seam: a live `v2xw-engine` run.
//!
//! [`crate::stub::StubEngine`] exists because this module could not: the transport was
//! written before the kernel. The kernel is here now, and this module is what binds it.
//!
//! # What the binding has to bridge
//!
//! `v2xw_engine::Engine` is not the same shape as [`crate::engine::Engine`], and the
//! difference is not cosmetic. Three facts about the kernel decide this module's design,
//! and each one is stated here because each one is a constraint a reader will otherwise
//! think was a choice:
//!
//! 1. **The kernel is not `Send`.** `v2xw_engine::Engine` holds `Box<dyn Mobility>`,
//!    `Box<dyn GnssModel>`, the two radio boxes and a `BTreeMap<NodeId, ObuRuntime>`, and
//!    none of those trait objects carries a `Send` bound — `v2xw_core::model::Model`, the
//!    supertrait of every family, does not require one (`v2xw-engine`'s `on_node_phase`
//!    documents the same consequence for `rayon`). The kernel therefore cannot be moved
//!    into a task, and it cannot live behind the `Mutex<Box<dyn Engine>>` [`crate::Run`]
//!    holds, because that box is `Send`. So the kernel is **built on its own thread and
//!    never leaves it**: [`spawn_host`] sends a `Scenario` (which is `Send`) across the
//!    boundary and the engine is constructed on the far side.
//! 2. **The run loop runs to the horizon.** `v2xw_engine::Engine::run` is one
//!    `while let Some(..) = scheduler.pop()` to the end of the scenario; the scheduler is
//!    private, so there is no `run_until` and no way to advance one step from outside. The
//!    step boundary this module needs is therefore taken from the **record stream**:
//!    [`StepRecorder`] watches the instant each record is emitted at and closes a step
//!    when that instant crosses a mobility-step boundary. Backpressure is a bounded
//!    channel — when the transport stops draining, the recorder's `send` blocks and the
//!    kernel stops inside it. Blocking there is safe precisely because the kernel reads no
//!    wall clock: stopping it for a second changes nothing it computes.
//! 3. **A record stream is not a scene.** `gt.kinematics`, `node.tx`, `phy.rx`,
//!    `node.verify` and `metric.sample` carry what happened; a `Keyframe` needs a *scene*.
//!    [`Projector`] rebuilds one: it holds the actor table, allocates the `u32` slots
//!    §0.1 requires to be stable for an actor's lifetime, and turns each channel's
//!    reader-side view into the §3.6 payload of its wire channel. Nothing is invented — a
//!    field the records do not carry is written as the §3.5.2 sentinel for *unknown*,
//!    which is the honest encoding and the one the client is required to handle.
//!
//! # The one thing the record stream does not carry
//!
//! **Which actor a node is mounted on.** `gt.kinematics` names an actor; `node.tx` names a
//! node; no channel joins them, and `v2xw_engine::Engine` exposes no accessor for the map
//! it keeps internally. [`Projector::equip`] reconstructs it from the three published
//! facts that decide it, and [`Projector::mapping_is_consistent`] reports whether every
//! node the run actually named was one the reconstruction accounted for. That check is the
//! reason the coupling is tolerable and not the reason it is a good idea: the engine should
//! publish the map, and this module says so in one place rather than being quietly wrong
//! in many.
//!
//! The three facts, each of which the reconstruction got wrong at least once:
//!
//! 1. **The draw.** `RngRegistry::checkout(RngDomain::Spawn, EntityRef::Actor(a))
//!    .bool(equipped_fraction)` — keyed by the actor, so it does not depend on how many
//!    spawned before it.
//! 2. **The counter starts after the masts.** One counter serves both minting sites, and
//!    `Engine::create_rsus` runs first, at build. A scenario with `n` roadside units puts
//!    them at `0..n` and its first vehicle at `n`; a reconstruction counting from zero
//!    shifts every vehicle's node id by `n`. See [`roadside_node_count`].
//! 3. **A node is named before its actor is.** The mobility phase publishes the state of
//!    the instant it is *dispatched* at, and a spawn's state belongs to the next instant,
//!    so an equipped vehicle's first frame lands one mobility step before its first
//!    `gt.kinematics` row. An id named ahead of its actor is held, not condemned: see
//!    [`Projector::unmapped_nodes`].
//!
//! # No wall clock
//!
//! Nothing here reads one. The host thread's pacing is the transport's
//! ([`crate::http::producer`]); the engine's own timeline is `SimTime` throughout, and the
//! manifest timestamp is [`LiveOptions::build_utc`], supplied by the caller exactly as
//! `v2xw_engine::Engine::build` requires.
