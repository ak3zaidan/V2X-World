//! `v2xw-server` — the control surface and the stream: JSON-RPC control plus the VWP
//! WebSocket of `docs/protocol/vwp-v1.md`.
//!
//! This crate is the transport a browser attaches to. It serves one run — live from an
//! engine or replayed from an MCAP recording — over one WebSocket endpoint, with the
//! JSON-RPC control plane of §6 on the text channel of the same socket and on `POST /rpc`.
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! | Concern | Module | Specification |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | HTTP router, the upgrade, the connection task, the producer | [`http`] | §1.1–§1.3, §1.5 |
//! | The connection state machine, resume, subscriptions, framing | [`session`] | §1.3, §1.4, §2.5, §5.3, §6.7, §6.12 |
//! | The resume ring and the priority send queue | [`ring`] | §1.4, §1.5 |
//! | The 32 methods and the 8 notifications | [`rpc`] | §6 |
//! | The OpenRPC 1.3.2 document | [`openrpc`] | §6.3 |
//! | The engine seam | [`engine`] | — |
//! | A live `v2xw-engine` run | [`live`] | — |
//! | A deterministic synthetic engine | [`stub`] | — |
//! | Replay from a recording | [`replay`] | §7 |
//! | The `{path, message, hint}` error surface | [`error`] | §6.4 |
//!
//! # One encoder
//!
//! Every VWP frame this crate sends is built by `v2xw-record`'s encoder, and every frame
//! it replays is one `v2xw-record`'s reader handed back. There is no second implementation
//! of the §3 layouts in this crate, on purpose: two encoders drift, and §7.2's
//! byte-identity guarantee is only provable if there is one path.
//!
//! The one exception is the three *connection* frames — `Hello` is built by `v2xw-record`,
//! but `Error` (§3.10) and `Bye` (§3.11) are written here, in [`http::error_frame`] and
//! [`http::bye_frame`], because they are connection-scoped and are never recorded, so the
//! recording crate has no encoder for them.
//!
//! # The rules this crate is written under
//!
//! * **No std transcendental.** Every one goes through [`v2xw_core::math`].
//! * **No wall clock below the transport.** [`http`] reads one, because §1.2's ping
//!   interval, §1.5's stall timeout and live pacing are wall-clock quantities by
//!   definition. Nothing else in the crate does, and no simulated or recorded value is
//!   derived from it.
//! * **No `std` `HashMap` iteration reaches an output.** Every table that decides what a
//!   frame or a JSON result contains is a `BTreeMap`, a `BTreeSet` or an explicitly sorted
//!   `Vec`.
//! * **No randomness.** The fixture engine has none at all (see [`stub`]); the transport
//!   has none to have.
//! * No `unsafe`, and every public item documented.
