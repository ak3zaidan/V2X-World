//! The followed node's message feed and queues: what it sent, what it heard, and what is
//! waiting inside it right now.
//!
//! The owner's ask: "when you go down into a specific chase view for a vehicle, the user
//! should be able to see the broadcast messages being sent out and their content, along
//! with the queue of that specific node."
//!
//! # Where the facts come from
//!
//! * **Sent.** Every `node.tx` record, joined by message id to the octets of the SPDU the
//!   node signed (`v2xw_engine::RunRecorder::tap_frame`). The content is decoded from those
//!   octets ([`decode`]), never from the record's own summary.
//! * **Received.** Every `node.rx` record at the node: the sender (ground truth), the fate
//!   and its single loss cause, the received power, the SINR, the distance, the signature
//!   verdict, and the message's journey stamp by stamp. A delivered message's content is
//!   decoded from the sender's SPDU, which is the octet string the receiver verified. The
//!   PHY's two "never detected" causes (`out-of-range`, `below-sensitivity`) are counted and
//!   not listed: the receiver cannot know about a frame it never detected, and with a 1 km
//!   candidate range they are most attempts.
//! * **Queues.** Reconstructed at the stream's instant from the same stamps: a received
//!   message is in the receive stage from its arrival to the end of its parse, in the
//!   verification queue from then until its signature check starts, being verified until it
//!   ends, and in the application queue until it is delivered; a generated message is in the
//!   transmit pipeline — the signing queue, the signer, then channel access — from its
//!   generation to the instant it goes on the air. These are the node runtime's own
//!   instants (`v2xw-node`, moved onto the simulation's timeline by the engine), so the
//!   depth and the waits are the model's, not a second model of it. The CRL task queue has
//!   no per-task stamps on any channel; its depth is the node's own telemetry window.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! The kernel runs up to a bounded distance ahead of the stream, so the feed is filled at
//! the kernel's frontier and read at the stream's instant. It keeps [`HISTORY_NS`] behind
//! the stream for every node — so a vehicle clicked a moment ago already has a past — plus
//! whatever lies ahead, and a hard per-node cap ([`MAX_PER_NODE`]) that counts what it
//! sheds. What reaches a client is bounded again per push ([`FeedLimits`]), newest first,
//! with the number left out.
