//! Counter-based deterministic random-number streams.
//!
//! There is **no shared sequential generator** in the engine. Every draw comes from a
//! [`RngStream`]: a ChaCha12 keystream whose 32-byte key is
//! `SHA-256(master_seed ‖ domain ‖ entity)` (ADR 0004 §3, 02-architecture.md §6.2).
//! Because the key depends only on *who is drawing and what for*, one entity's draw
//! sequence is independent of every other entity's activity, of the order in which
//! events fire, and of the thread count. This is the generalisation of the legacy
//! engine's per-vehicle string-keyed streams (`f"{seed}:sensor:{vid}"`, 01-inventory §3),
//! and it removes their order dependence.
//!
//! A plug-in never owns an RNG. It asks the engine context for the stream of the entity
//! it is acting for ([`crate::ctx::Ctx::rng`], 03-interfaces.md §1.1), which resolves to
//! [`RngRegistry::checkout`].
//!
//! # Key derivation (stable; changing it invalidates every golden digest)
//!
//! ```text
//! key = SHA-256( master_seed_le(8) ‖ domain_code_le(4) ‖ entity_encoding )
//! ```
//!
//! with `entity_encoding` as documented on [`EntityRef::encode`] and `domain_code` as
//! documented on [`RngDomain::code`].
//!
//! # One accessor, usable from a parallel phase
//!
//! Parallelism in this engine is phase-parallel: pure maps over actors, receivers or
//! nodes, merged in id order (02-architecture.md §6.4, ADR 0004 decision 5). Draws happen
//! *inside* those maps, so the registry accessor must take `&self`:
//! [`RngRegistry::checkout`] does, and is the one sanctioned way to draw. It hands out an
//! [`RngGuard`] that borrows the stream out of a sharded, individually locked cache and
//! returns it on drop, so
//!
//! * the value sequence of a key is identical whether the draw happened on the event loop
//!   or inside a `rayon` map, with any thread count (`parallel_phase_is_thread_count_independent`
//!   in this module's tests pins it byte for byte for 1 and 8 threads);
//! * a second task that asks for a key already checked out **panics** instead of silently
//!   receiving a stream restarted at word 0.
//!
//! [`RngRegistry::stream`] is the same cache reached through `&mut self`, for the
//! single-threaded event loop where no locking is wanted. Both paths share one cache, so
//! they cannot disagree. [`RngStream::derive`] and [`RngRegistry::ephemeral`] bypass the
//! cache and are documented traps: they restart a stream at word 0 every time.
//!
//! # Two scope lifetimes
//!
//! Keys come in two kinds, distinguished by [`EntityRef::is_single_use`]:
//!
//! * **long-lived** (`Global`, `Actor`, `Node`, `Link`, `Lane`, `Signal`, `Custom`) — the
//!   stream is cached, so consecutive draws for one key continue the same keystream;
//! * **single-use** ([`EntityRef::LinkFrame`], whose key already embeds a per-frame
//!   counter) — the stream is derived, used and dropped. Caching those would intern one
//!   ~300-byte generator per frame per directed link: at the design target (10,000 nodes,
//!   10 Hz, ~50 neighbours, 60 s) some 3 × 10⁸ streams, tens of gigabytes.
//!
//! [`RngRegistry::checkout`] routes on that flag by itself, so a call site cannot get it
//! wrong; [`RngRegistry::stream`] rejects single-use scopes in debug builds because it
//! has nowhere to put a stream it must not cache.
//!
//! # One domain, one purpose
//!
//! Order-independence is a property of a *key*, not of an entity: if two models draw from
//! the same `(domain, entity)` key their draws interleave, and each model's sequence then
//! depends on which model ran first. A domain therefore names one purpose — this is why
//! [`RngDomain::DesiredSpeed`] and [`RngDomain::ReactionTime`] are separate from
//! [`RngDomain::Mobility`] — and an out-of-tree plug-in's domain is derived from its model
//! id ([`PluginDomain::for_model`]) rather than picked by hand, so two independently
//! written plug-ins cannot land on the same code.
//!
//! # Samplers
//!
//! Every distribution is implemented here, with a fixed algorithm and a documented draw
//! count, using [`crate::math`] for transcendentals — never the platform libm and never
//! the `rand` crate's distributions, whose algorithms may change between versions
//! (02-architecture.md §6.2).
