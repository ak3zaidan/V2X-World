//! The engine context handed to every plug-in call, and the records a plug-in emits.
//!
//! [`Ctx`] is 03-interfaces.md §1.1 in code. It is the only thing a model sees of the
//! engine: the clock, its RNG streams, the event heap, the world and actor index, the
//! recorder, the provenance log and its own resolved parameters. Every family trait in
//! `v2xw-world`, `-mobility`, `-radio`, `-net`, `-msg`, `-node`, `-proto`, `-threat` and
//! `-metrics` is declared against it, so they all share one context instead of each crate
//! inventing an incompatible one. The kernel in this crate owns the pieces it is built
//! from ([`Scheduler`], [`RngRegistry`], [`ProvenanceLog`], [`ParamSet`]); the world and
//! the actor index live in `v2xw-world`, which is why they are associated types rather
//! than concrete ones.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! ```text
//! &self      now, rng, world, actors, params      — readable while anything else is borrowed
//! &mut self  schedule, cancel, emit, why          — mutate the kernel
//! ```
//!
//! [`Ctx::rng`] takes `&self` and returns an [`RngGuard`] rather than taking `&mut self`
//! and returning `&mut RngStream`. That is not a detail: `&mut self` would make
//!
//! ```text
//! let noise = ctx.rng(Mobility, actor).normal(0.0, sigma);   // &mut borrow ends here
//! let leader = ctx.world().leader_of(actor);                 // ok
//! ctx.schedule(t, MobilityStep, payload);                    // ok
//! ```
//!
//! fine but
//!
//! ```text
//! let d = ctx.world().lane(l).length_m;       // &self borrow, still live below
//! let jitter = ctx.rng(Mobility, actor).f64() * d;   // &mut self — will not compile
//! ```
//!
//! fail, which is the first thing real model code does; and it would make the whole
//! context unusable inside the phase-parallel maps of 02-architecture.md §6.4, where the
//! context is shared by reference across `rayon` tasks. With `&self` both compile, and
//! the borrow checker still stops a guard being held across a `&mut self` call — which is
//! what we want, because that call may schedule an event and the guard must be back in
//! the registry before the next task asks for it.
//!
//! # Dyn-compatible on purpose
//!
//! In-process Rust plug-ins are trait objects (ADR 0007 §8), so a family trait method
//! takes `&mut dyn Ctx<World = …, Actors = …, Payload = …>`. That requires [`Ctx`] itself
//! to be dyn-compatible, which is why the generic `emit<R: Record>` of 03-interfaces.md
//! §1.1 is split: [`Ctx::emit_erased`] is the object-safe primitive an engine implements,
//! and [`CtxExt::emit`] is the generic convenience every caller uses. `CtxExt` is
//! blanket-implemented, including for `dyn Ctx`, so the ergonomics are the published ones.
