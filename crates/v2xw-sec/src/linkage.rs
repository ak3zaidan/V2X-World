//! SCMS linkage values — CAMP SCP2.
//!
//! A port of `legacy/scms_sim_ref/scms_core/linkage.py`, algorithm for algorithm, with the
//! Python's own outputs as the acceptance vectors (see the crate's
//! `tests/legacy_vectors.rs`). Faithful to the CAMP SCMS PoC "SCP2: Linkage Values"
//! specification and to Brecht et al., *A Security Credential Management System for V2X
//! Communications* (IEEE T-ITS 2018, arXiv:1802.05323).
//!
//! # The three formulas
//!
//! Per Linkage Authority `x ∈ {1, 2}`, with a 16-bit `la_id_x`:
//!
//! ```text
//! seed chain  : ls_x(i)      = trunc₁₂₈( SHA-256( la_id_x ‖ ls_x(i−1) ‖ 0¹¹² ) )
//! pre-linkage : plv_x(i, j)  = trunc₇₂ ( AES(ls_x(i), la_id_x ‖ j ‖ 0⁸⁰) ⊕ (la_id_x ‖ j ‖ 0⁸⁰) )
//! linkage val : lv(i, j)     = plv_1(i, j) ⊕ plv_2(i, j)
//! ```
//!
//! The widths are fixed by the specification and are not tuning knobs: `la_id` 2 bytes,
//! `ls` 16, `j` 4 inside the AES block, `plv` and `lv` 9 bytes (72 bits). A 9-byte linkage
//! value is what `Ieee1609Dot2BaseTypes.asn`'s `LinkageValue` declares, and it is what
//! [`LinkageValue::to_asn1`] produces.
//!
//! # The three privacy properties, and where each one lives in the code
//!
//! * **Two-authority split.** Only the PCA ever computes `lv`, because it is the XOR of
//!   two values held by two separate authorities. Neither `plv` on its own is the value in
//!   the certificate — [`linkage_value`] is the only function that combines them, and
//!   [`DeviceLinkageContext`] colocates the two seeds *only* for the reference engine and
//!   says so.
//! * **Forward-only revocation.** Publishing `ls_x(i)` reveals a device's certificates
//!   from period `i` onward and no earlier, because a hash chain does not run backwards.
//!   That is [`CrlLinkageEntry::matches`]'s `cert_i < self.i` guard, and it is the reason
//!   the guard is a *correctness* requirement rather than an optimisation: without it the
//!   simulator would report a privacy property the real system has, on an implementation
//!   that does not have it.
//! * **O(1) CRL cost.** Two 128-bit seeds revoke every certificate a device will ever
//!   hold, for every future period, however many were issued. That is why a linkage entry
//!   is about 40 bytes per vehicle and 10,000 entries is about 400 KB (04-models.md §9.6)
//!   rather than one entry per certificate.
