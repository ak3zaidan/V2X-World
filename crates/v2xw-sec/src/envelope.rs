//! The security envelope: IEEE 1609.2 `SignedData` and the ETSI TS 103 097 profile.
//!
//! Real COER through the generated bindings, not a size model. A [`SecuredPdu`]'s bytes
//! are bytes a conformant receiver would accept, and its size is therefore exact by
//! construction rather than by a table (invariant I-S3).
//!
//! # What signing actually computes
//!
//! IEEE 1609.2 §5.3.1 does not sign the message. It signs
//!
//! ```text
//! H( H(tbsData) ‖ H(signer identifier input) )
//! ```
//!
//! where the *signer identifier input* is the COER encoding of the signer's own
//! certificate — **including when the signer identifier on the wire is only a digest**.
//! That is the detail that makes a hand-rolled implementation interoperate with nothing:
//! attaching a digest saves 70-odd bytes on the wire but changes nothing about what was
//! signed, because the receiver looks the certificate up and hashes it itself. So
//! [`SignerHandle`] carries the certificate's encoding whichever identifier policy is in
//! force, and [`Envelope::sign`] hashes it either way.
//!
//! # The two profiles
//!
//! `EtsiTs103097Data` is a *profile* of `Ieee1609Dot2Data`, not a different type — the
//! generated binding is a delegate newtype, so the bytes are identical and there is no
//! separate trailer [TS 103 097 V2.1.1 §5.1-5.2]. What differs is what is allowed:
//! `generationTime` is mandatory, `p2pcdLearningRequest` and `missingCrlIdentifier` are
//! forbidden, and DENM must carry `generationLocation` and must sign with a certificate
//! [§7.1.2]. [`EnvelopeProfile::EtsiTs103097`] enforces those at signing time rather than
//! trusting the caller, because a profile violation produces bytes that decode fine and
//! are rejected in the field.
//!
//! # Deviations from 03-interfaces.md §6, and why
//!
//! The crate is normative for signatures and the document tracks it (build decision D11).
//! Three differences:
//!
//! * **Generic over the context.** `&mut dyn Ctx` is not a type — [`Ctx`] has three
//!   associated types with no defaults — so the published signature does not compile.
//!   Parameterising over `C: Ctx + ?Sized` is what `v2xw-msg` already does for
//!   `MessageGenerator`, and with `?Sized` the parameter may itself be a trait object.
//! * **`sign` takes the crypto backend, and takes `&self`.** The published signature has
//!   the envelope owning its backend and mutating itself. Passing the backend makes the
//!   envelope stateless, which has two concrete consequences: it is `Sync`, so it can be
//!   called from inside the phase-parallel maps of 02-architecture.md §6.4; and the *same*
//!   envelope instance can be driven by the real and the modelled backend in one test,
//!   which is what makes the I-S1 equivalence test evidence rather than a re-run.
//! * **`sign` takes a [`HeaderInfoSpec`] rather than a `HeaderInfo`.** The envelope fills
//!   `generationTime` from the simulation clock and `generationLocation` from the
//!   profile's rules; handing it a finished `HeaderInfo` would mean every caller
//!   duplicating the 1609.2 epoch conversion, and one of them getting it wrong.
