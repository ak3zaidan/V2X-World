# VWP v1 — V2X World Simulator wire protocol (engine ↔ UI)

Status: **normative, implementable**. Version `1.1` (2026-09-24: `view.follow {feed}` and the `node.feed`
notification, §6.7.1; additive under §8.4). Version `1.0`: 2026-09-18.

Implements `docs/adr/0008-recording-format-and-engine-ui-protocol.md`, `docs/design/02-architecture.md` §9,
`docs/design/09-ui.md` §2/§5/§7/§8, `docs/design/03-interfaces.md` §14, `docs/design/06-node-models.md` §2.4.

This document is written so that a Rust server implementer and a TypeScript client implementer, working
independently and without talking to each other, produce interoperable code. Everything is concrete; there
is no `TBD`. Where the design documents left a choice open, the choice is made here and marked
**`DECISION`** with a one-line reason. All such lines are collected in Appendix C.

## 0. Conventions

- **MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / MAY** are used as in RFC 2119.
- All multi-byte integers and floats are **little-endian**. IEEE-754 binary32 (`f32`) and binary64 (`f64`).
- Byte offsets written `@n` are relative to the start of the enclosing structure unless stated otherwise.
- A "sentinel" value means "absent": `0xFFFF_FFFF` for `u32` ids, `0xFFFF` for `u16`, `0xFF` for `u8`,
  `NaN` for floats, `u64::MAX` for `u64` times.
- `SimTime` is `u64` nanoseconds since `t0` (03-interfaces §1). Wall-clock times are `i64` nanoseconds
  since the Unix epoch, UTC.
- Spatial coordinates are **world-local ENU metres** (East, North, Up) about `Hello.origin_{lat,lon,alt}`,
  matching `Vec3` in 03-interfaces §1.
- Headings follow 03-interfaces §1: `0` = East, counter-clockwise, in the ENU plane.
- "Reserved" bytes MUST be written as zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the reader.

### 0.1 Naming

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **frame** | one WebSocket message (binary or text) |
| **canonical frame** | a binary frame that is part of the recorded stream: `Keyframe`, `Delta`, `Telemetry`, `Event`, `MetricSample`, `Provenance`, `WorldChunk` |
| **connection frame** | `Hello`, `Error`, `Bye` — connection-scoped, not part of the canonical stream |
| **GOP** | group of pictures: one `Keyframe` plus the `Delta`s that follow it until the next `Keyframe` |
| **slot** | a stable `u32` index identifying an actor's row for its lifetime (09-ui §2 "actor slot") |
| **profile** | `full` or `node`; see §5 |

---

## 1. Transport

### 1.1 Endpoint

One WebSocket endpoint per engine process:

```
GET /vwp/v1?run=<run_id>&session=<token>&resume=<seq>&profile=<full|node>&compress=<zstd|none>&v=1
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: vwp.v1
```

The server MUST echo `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: vwp.v1`. A server that does not implement `vwp.v1` MUST fail
the upgrade with HTTP 426. **`DECISION`: the subprotocol token carries the major version so a mismatched
client fails at the handshake instead of at the first frame.**

Query parameters (all optional):

| Param | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `run` | the server's current run | run id (36-char UUID string) to attach to, or `latest` |
| `session` | absent | the `Hello.str_session_token` of the session to resume (§1.4) |
| `resume` | absent | canonical `seq` to resume from (§1.4); meaningful only with `session` |
| `profile` | `full` | `full` or `node` (§5). Immutable for the life of the connection. |
| `compress` | `zstd` | `zstd` or `none`. A client that cannot decompress zstd MUST pass `compress=none`. |
| `v` | `1` | protocol major version the client speaks |

Companion HTTP endpoints on the same origin and port:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/world/{hash}.vwb` | world geometry, `vwp-world/1` binary (§4) |
| `GET` | `/world/{hash}.json` | world geometry, `vwp-world/1` JSON (§4.6) |
| `POST` | `/rpc` | one-shot JSON-RPC (§6.2) for CLI/notebook/CI clients |
| `GET` | `/rpc/schema` | the OpenRPC 1.3.2 document (`rpc.discover` result, §6.3) |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | `200 {"ok":true,"engine":"...","runs":[...]}` |

All HTTP responses and the WebSocket upgrade MUST carry, per 09-ui §2 (cross-origin isolation for
`SharedArrayBuffer`):

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

World responses are content-addressed and therefore immutable:
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` and `ETag: "<hash>"`.

Binding and auth follow 02-architecture §12: localhost by default; a non-loopback bind requires
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` on the upgrade and on every HTTP request, and the server MUST reject
missing/incorrect tokens with HTTP 401 (upgrade) — never with a WebSocket close, so the browser sees a
real status.

### 1.2 Telling binary from text

WebSocket already separates the two at the framing layer; VWP adds no in-band discriminator.

- **Binary frames** (opcode `0x2`) are VWP telemetry frames (§2). Nothing else is ever sent as binary.
- **Text frames** (opcode `0x1`) are UTF-8 JSON-RPC 2.0 messages (§6). Nothing else is ever sent as text.

TypeScript client:

```ts
ws.binaryType = "arraybuffer";
ws.onmessage = (ev) => {
  if (typeof ev.data === "string") handleJsonRpc(JSON.parse(ev.data));
  else handleVwpFrame(new DataView(ev.data as ArrayBuffer));
};
```

Rust server (`tokio-tungstenite`): `Message::Binary(_)` vs `Message::Text(_)`.

A conforming client MUST NOT send binary frames in v1; a server receiving one MUST reply with an `Error`
frame (`code = -32600`) and MAY close with 1003. A server MUST NOT send a text frame that is not valid
JSON-RPC 2.0.

`Ping`/`Pong` (opcodes `0x9`/`0xA`) are used for liveness: the server MUST send a Ping every 15 s of wall
time and MUST close the connection with 1001 if no Pong arrives within 30 s.

### 1.3 Handshake

**The client sends nothing first.** Immediately after the WebSocket handshake completes, the server sends
exactly one `Hello` binary frame (§3.1), within 1000 ms wall time. Sequence:

```
client                                    server
  |---- HTTP GET /vwp/v1 (Upgrade) ------->|
  |<--- 101 Switching Protocols -----------|
  |<=== BINARY Hello ======================|   <= mandatory, first frame, always uncompressed
  |          (client may now fetch the world over HTTP by Hello.world_hash)
  |---- TEXT {"jsonrpc":"2.0",...} ------->|   <= control, at any time
  |<=== BINARY Keyframe (FLAG_RESYNC) =====|
  |<=== BINARY Delta ======================|
  |<=== BINARY Telemetry / Event / Metric =|
```

Rules:

1. `Hello` MUST be the first frame and MUST NOT be compressed (`FLAG_COMPRESSED` clear), so a client can
   parse it before it knows whether it can decompress.
2. The first canonical frame after a non-resumed `Hello` MUST be a `Keyframe` with `FLAG_RESYNC` set.
3. A client MUST NOT assume it has the world before it has fetched it; it MUST buffer or discard
   `Keyframe`/`Delta` frames until the world is loaded (it may also render actors on a blank ground plane).
4. If the run is not started (`hello_flags & HELLO_PAUSED`), the server sends the `Hello` and then nothing
   until `run.start`/`run.resume`.
5. A server that cannot serve the requested major version MUST send `Error{code:-32050}` followed by `Bye`
   and close with code **4406**.

### 1.4 Reconnect and resume

Every canonical frame carries a 64-bit `seq` (§2.1) assigned by the *producer* (live engine or replay
reader) in canonical emission order, starting at 0 for the first canonical frame of the run. `seq` is
deterministic: the same run replayed produces the same `seq` for the same frame.

The server keeps a **resume ring** of recently produced canonical frames for every *session*.
**`DECISION`: the resume ring holds `max(2 GOPs, 8 MiB)` and at most 4096 frames — two GOPs guarantee that
any resume point is preceded by a retained keyframe, and 8 MiB bounds memory at ~10,000 actors.**

**`DECISION` (2026-09-23): a session outlives its socket.** Every `Hello` names its session in
`str_session_token` (§3.1.1), an opaque token the server mints per session. `seq`, the symbol table,
the subscriptions (§6.7, §6.12) and the ring belong to the session, not to the socket. When a socket goes
away without a clean close — anything but close code 1000 from the client — the server keeps the session
for **120 s** of wall time (at most 8 retained sessions, the oldest evicted first) and **keeps encoding the
run into its ring** exactly as it would have for the socket. A client that closes with 1000 has ended its
session and cannot resume it.

On reconnect the client sends `?session=<token>&resume=<seq>` where `token` is its last `Hello`'s
`str_session_token` and `seq` is one past the last frame it fully applied. The server then:

1. **Resumable** — the session is retained, the run has not started a new generation since the client's
   last `Hello`, and either `seq` is the session's next `seq` (the client missed nothing) or `seq` is in the
   ring *and* the `Keyframe` opening `seq`'s GOP is also in the ring: the server sends `Hello` with
   `HELLO_RESUMED` set, `resume_seq = seq`, and then replays the ring from `seq` — the frames the client
   missed, byte for byte as they were first encoded, followed by the live stream. There is no resync
   keyframe and no `seq` gap. The client keeps its world, string table, actor slots and camera state.
   The resumed `Hello`'s symbol table is the table **as the client held it at `seq`**: strings a
   replayed §3.8 extension appends are not in it, so the replay extends the table exactly as the original
   frames did; a node whose label is not in that table carries label id 0 until the next non-resumed
   `Hello`. The session's subscriptions and follow are kept, so the client does not re-send them.
   Notifications (§6.14) produced while it was away are delivered after the replay, up to 64.
2. **Not resumable** — the server sends `Hello` *without* `HELLO_RESUMED` (`resume_seq` = the next seq it
   will emit), then a `Keyframe` with `FLAG_RESYNC`. The client MUST discard all stream state except a
   world whose content hash equals `Hello.world_hash`, and MUST reset its string table (§2.5) to empty.
   This is also the answer to a `session` the server does not hold (expired, evicted, ended with 1000, or
   from another server process), to a `resume` without a `session`, and to a resume across a `run.start`:
   the client gets a new session, with a new token.
3. **Unknown run** — `Error{code:-32000}` then `Bye{reason=3}`, close 4404.

A new connection presenting the session token of a connection that is still open supersedes it — the
server cannot tell a half-open socket from a live one, and the client that holds the token is the one that
is asking: the server sends `Bye{reason = 4 (superseded)}` on the old socket, closes it with 1012, and
resumes the session on the new one as above. A reconnect asking for a different `profile` is a new session
(§5.3: the profile is immutable for a session).

The client SHOULD reconnect with exponential backoff 250 ms → 8 s with ±20 % jitter, and MUST stop
retrying after `Bye{reason = 0 (run-complete)}` or close code 4406/4404. **`DECISION` (2026-09-23): a server whose runs can be started again (a live engine, the fixture) does not send `Bye{reason = 0}` at the end of a run** — it marks the last frame `FLAG_END_OF_RUN`, publishes `run.state {state: "finished"}`, and keeps the connection, so the client can seek back through the finished run and `run.start` a new one on the same socket. `Bye{reason = 0}` remains the signal for a server that will serve nothing further.

### 1.5 Backpressure — the server never queues unboundedly

The simulation loop MUST NOT block on the socket. Each connection has a bounded send queue:

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `max_queued_frames` | 64 | frames awaiting the socket |
| `max_queued_bytes` | 8 MiB | sum of queued frame sizes |
| `stall_timeout_s` | 30 | wall seconds over cap before the server gives up |
| `resync_deadline_ms` | 250 | wall ms after a drop within which a Keyframe must be emitted |

Frames have a fixed priority class:

| Class | Frames | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | `Hello`, `Error`, `Bye`, `WorldChunk`, all JSON-RPC text | **never dropped**; if P0 cannot be queued the connection is closed with 1011 |
| P1 | `Keyframe` | **never dropped**, but **coalesced**: at most one queued keyframe; a newer one replaces an older one |
| P2 | `Delta` | droppable, all-or-nothing (see below) |
| P3 | `Telemetry`, `MetricSample`, `Event` | droppable, oldest-first, per class |

On enqueue, if either cap would be exceeded the server MUST, in this order, until it is under cap:

1. Drop **every** queued `Delta` and set `resync_pending = true`. Deltas are never partially dropped — a
   surviving delta after a dropped one would be applied against the wrong base (§3.4).
2. Drop queued P3 frames oldest-first, counting them per class.
3. Replace the queued `Keyframe` with the newest one.
4. If still over cap, stop producing frames for this connection and record the time; if that condition
   persists for `stall_timeout_s`, send `Bye{reason=3}` and close with **1013 (Try Again Later)**.

When `resync_pending` is true the server MUST emit a `Keyframe` with `FLAG_RESYNC` at the next keyframe
boundary, or — if that boundary is more than `resync_deadline_ms` of wall time away — **synthesise one
immediately**. Synthesising is always legal: a keyframe is an idempotent snapshot of the current state.
An out-of-band keyframe still consumes a `seq` and still carries the canonical body, so a client that
records the stream gets a valid (if denser) GOP structure.

Drops are reported to the client as a **JSON-RPC notification**, not in a binary frame, so that binary
frames remain byte-identical between live and replay (§7.2):

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"stream.drop",
 "params":{"seq_first":10422,"seq_last":10461,
           "dropped":{"delta":38,"event":2,"telemetry":0,"metric":0},
           "resync_seq":10462}}
```

The client MUST treat a `seq` gap as a drop even if the notification is lost, and MUST NOT interpolate
across a `FLAG_RESYNC` keyframe (it re-seeds its pose rings from it instead).

**Live pacing.** By default a slow client does not slow the engine. `run.speed` with `"sync":"client"`
(§6.6) makes the engine block on a high-water mark so demos stay lossless; this is the only mode in which
the socket can throttle the simulation, and the manifest records it.

## 2. Binary framing

### 2.1 Frame header — 24 bytes, fixed

Every binary frame is `header (24 B) || body`.

| @ | Size | Type | Field | Value / meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `u32` | `magic` | `0x31505756`; its little-endian wire bytes are `56 57 50 31` = ASCII `V W P 1` |
| 4 | 2 | `u16` | `version` | protocol **major** version. `1` in this document. |
| 6 | 2 | `u16` | `msg_type` | §2.4 |
| 8 | 4 | `u32` | `body_len` | length in bytes of the **uncompressed** body |
| 12 | 2 | `u16` | `flags` | §2.3 |
| 14 | 2 | `u16` | `reserved` | `0` |
| 16 | 8 | `u64` | `seq` | canonical sequence number (§1.4) |

Body starts at frame offset **24**.

If `FLAG_COMPRESSED` is clear, the remaining bytes of the WebSocket message are the body and their length
MUST equal `body_len`. If set, the remaining bytes are a zstd frame (RFC 8878) whose decompressed length
MUST equal `body_len`.

A reader MUST reject a frame whose `magic` is wrong (close 1002), MUST ignore a frame whose `msg_type` it
does not know, and MUST ignore trailing bytes beyond the layouts defined here (§8).

### 2.2 Alignment

**`DECISION`: every scalar array in a body is placed at a body-relative offset that is a multiple of its
element size, so both Rust (`bytemuck::cast_slice`) and TypeScript (`new Float64Array(buf, off, n)`) can
build views with zero copying and zero parsing.**

Because the header is 24 bytes and 24 is a multiple of 8, an offset that is 8-, 4- or 2-aligned relative
to the body is equally aligned relative to the frame. A client that decompresses a body into a fresh
`ArrayBuffer` gets body offset 0, which satisfies the same rule. Therefore:

- A TypeScript client MAY view an uncompressed frame in place: `new Int32Array(frame, 24 + off, n)`.
- WebSocket `ArrayBuffer`s delivered by browsers start at byte 0 of their own buffer, so this is safe.
- Sections are padded with zero bytes to the next multiple of 4 unless a stricter alignment is stated.
- Every `off_*` field is a `u32` body-relative byte offset; **`0` means "section absent"** (a section can
  never legitimately start at 0, because every body begins with a fixed prefix).

### 2.3 Flags

| Bit | Mask | Name | Class | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x0001` | `FLAG_COMPRESSED` | transport | body is a zstd frame |
| 1 | `0x0002` | `FLAG_RESYNC` | transport | discard interpolation state; this Keyframe re-seeds it |
| 2 | `0x0004` | `FLAG_NODE_ONLY` | **canonical** | produced under the `node` profile (§5) |
| 3 | `0x0008` | `FLAG_END_OF_RUN` | **canonical** | last canonical frame at the end of the run |
| 4 | `0x0010` | `FLAG_CONTINUED` | transport | one of several frames carrying one logical unit (`WorldChunk`) |
| 5 | `0x0020` | `FLAG_SEEK_RESULT` | transport | this Keyframe answers a `run.seek` |
| 6–15 | — | reserved | — | MUST be 0 |

`CANONICAL_FLAG_MASK = 0x000C`, `TRANSPORT_FLAG_MASK = 0x0033`. §7.2 depends on this split.

### 2.4 Message types

| Id | Name | Direction | Cadence | Body §|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0001` | `Hello` | S→C | once per connection, first frame | §3.1 |
| `0x0002` | `Keyframe` | S→C | every `keyframe_period_ns` (default 1 s sim), plus resync/seek | §3.3 |
| `0x0003` | `Delta` | S→C | every `mobility_step_ns` (default 100 ms sim) | §3.4 |
| `0x0004` | `Telemetry` | S→C | every `telemetry_period_ns` (default 1 s sim), subscribed nodes only | §3.5 |
| `0x0005` | `Event` | S→C | one batch per mobility step, subscribed channels only | §3.6 |
| `0x0006` | `MetricSample` | S→C | every `metric_period_ns` (default 1 s sim) | §3.7 |
| `0x0007` | `Provenance` | S→C | after `Hello`, then on demand (`explain`, new model instances) | §3.8 |
| `0x0008` | `WorldChunk` | S→C | only when `world_ref.mode = 1` (static/WASM hosting) | §3.9 |
| `0x00FE` | `Error` | S→C | on error | §3.10 |
| `0x00FF` | `Bye` | S→C | once, last frame | §3.11 |

Ids `0x0009`–`0x00FD` and `0x0100`–`0xFFFF` are reserved. Client→server binary frames do not exist in v1.

`seq` accounting: canonical frames (`0x0002`–`0x0008`) consume `seq` values 0,1,2,…; `Hello`, `Error` and
`Bye` carry `seq` = the seq the **next** canonical frame will have, and do not consume one.

### 2.5 The symbol table

Strings on the wire are interned. A **string id** is a `u32` index into a per-connection, append-only
symbol table.

- Id `0` is always the empty string.
- `Hello` establishes ids `0..n-1`.
- Each `Provenance` frame MAY append entries; its own table's first entry takes the id equal to the
  current table size. Ids are never reassigned within a connection.
- A non-resumed `Hello` resets the table.

Serialised **StrTable** layout (4-byte aligned start):

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `u32` | `n` — number of strings |
| 4 | 4 | `u32` | `blob_bytes` — UTF-8 bytes, excluding padding |
| 8 | `4(n+1)` | `u32[n+1]` | `offsets` — `offsets[0] = 0`, `offsets[n] = blob_bytes`, non-decreasing |
| 8+4(n+1) | `blob_bytes` | `u8[]` | UTF-8 blob, zero-padded to a multiple of 4 |

String `i` is `blob[offsets[i] .. offsets[i+1]]`. Total section size is
`8 + 4(n+1) + ceil4(blob_bytes)`.

### 2.6 Compression

**`DECISION`: zstd (RFC 8878) is the only compression on the wire, because the MCAP recording already uses
zstd (ADR 0008) so one decoder covers live and replay.** Rust: `zstd` crate. TypeScript: `fzstd` (MIT,
pure JS, ~10 KB) or a WASM build — the client declares support by *not* passing `compress=none`.

Rules:

- `Hello` is never compressed.
- The server SHOULD compress a body only when `body_len >= 4096`; below that the ratio does not pay for
  the allocation.
- Compression level 3 (zstd default) — **`DECISION`: level 3 keeps encode under 1 ms for a 300 KB
  keyframe, which is the whole point of not blocking the sim loop.**
- `FLAG_COMPRESSED` is a **transport** flag: it is not part of the recorded bytes (§7.2).

---

## 3. Message layouts

### 3.0 Encoding choice

**`DECISION`: v1 uses a hand-rolled, flat, fixed-layout struct-of-arrays encoding, not FlatBuffers.**

ADR 0008 chose FlatBuffers. For v1 that is the wrong trade, for four reasons, and the ADR is amended here:

1. **Zero parsing, not just zero copy.** A FlatBuffers vector still costs a vtable indirection and a bounds
   check per field access, and a vector-of-tables costs one offset read per element. A fixed
   struct-of-arrays lets both sides do `bytemuck::cast_slice::<u8, i32>(&body[off..off+4*n])` /
   `new Int32Array(frame, 24 + off, n)` — the pose columns land in the `SharedArrayBuffer` rings of
   09-ui §2 with a single `set()` and no per-actor JS work, which is exactly the hot path the UI budget
   (09-ui §4) is built around.
2. **Two implementations stay in lockstep more easily with one table than with one compiler.** A `.fbs`
   schema requires `flatc` in the Rust build, the pnpm build and the Python build, pinned to the same
   version, plus generated code checked in or generated thrice. A 24-byte header and ten offset tables are
   reviewable in a diff.
3. **The recorder stores exactly these bytes** (§7.2), so there is one layout, not a wire format plus a
   storage format.
4. **We do not need FlatBuffers' evolution model.** §8 gives a narrower, sufficient one: reserved bytes,
   `record_size`, and new `off_*` sections.

What we give up: optional fields, unions, and free-form nesting. Those are used only in `Hello`,
`Provenance` and `Error`, which are cold and use the symbol table instead. Arbitrary structured data
(inspector snapshots, scenarios, manifests) travels as JSON over JSON-RPC, where it belongs.

### 3.1 `Hello` (`0x0001`)

Body = **fixed prefix (256 B)** ‖ node table ‖ class table ‖ channel table ‖ world ref ‖ symbol table.

#### 3.1.2 `hello_flags`

| Bit | Mask | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x0000_0001` | `HELLO_LIVE` | stream is produced by a live engine |
| 1 | `0x0000_0002` | `HELLO_REPLAY` | stream is produced by the replay reader from an MCAP file |
| 2 | `0x0000_0004` | `HELLO_NODE_ONLY` | connection is in the `node` profile (§5) |

| 7 | `0x0000_0080` | `HELLO_WRITABLE` | control methods that mutate the run are permitted on this connection |

Exactly one of `HELLO_LIVE` / `HELLO_REPLAY` MUST be set.

#### 3.1.3 Node table (`node_count = N`, 32·N bytes, 4-aligned)

Columns in this order, each a contiguous array of length `N`:

| # | Type | Column | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[N]` | `node_id` | ascending, dense where possible (03-interfaces §1) |
| 2 | `u32[N]` | `actor_id` | `0xFFFFFFFF` if the node is not mounted on an actor |
| 3 | `f32[N]` | `pos_x_m` | static nodes: fixed position; mobile nodes: position at `t0` |
| 4 | `f32[N]` | `pos_y_m` | |
| 5 | `f32[N]` | `pos_z_m` | antenna height included |
| 6 | `u32[N]` | `str_label` | e.g. `"veh_0421"`, `"rsu_north"` |
| 7 | `u32[N]` | `str_profile_id` | hardware profile id, e.g. `"obu/cohda-mk5"` (06-node-models §7) |
| 8 | `u16[N]` | `flags` | bit0 `HAS_HSM`, bit1 `IS_ATTACKER` **[GT]**, bit2 `IS_BACKEND`, bit3 `HAS_BACKHAUL`, bit4 `HAS_UU`, bits 5–15 reserved |
| 9 | `u8[N]` | `kind` | `0` obu, `1` vru-device, `2` rsu, `3` base-station, `4` router, `5` backend-entity, `6` other |
| 10 | `u8[N]` | `class_idx` | index into the class table, `0xFF` if not an actor |

Nodes that appear mid-run are announced on `sec.cert`/`gt.spawn` and in `Delta.spawns`; the node table is
the set known at connect time.

#### 3.1.4 Actor-class table (`class_count = C`, 24·C bytes, 4-aligned)

| # | Type | Column | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[C]` | `str_name` | `"car"`, `"truck"`, `"bus"`, `"moto"`, `"bicycle"`, `"pedestrian"`, … |
| 2 | `f32[C]` | `length_m` | `Dims` (03-interfaces §1) |
| 3 | `f32[C]` | `width_m` | |
| 4 | `f32[C]` | `height_m` | |
| 5 | `u32[C]` | `color_rgba` | renderer hint, `0xRRGGBBAA` as a big-endian-looking literal stored LE |
| 6 | `u16[C]` | `reserved16` | 0 |
| 7 | `u8[C]` | `category` | `0` vehicle, `1` vru, `2` infrastructure, `3` other |
| 8 | `u8[C]` | `reserved8` | 0 |

#### 3.1.5 Channel table (`channel_count = K`, 8·K bytes, 4-aligned)

| # | Type | Column | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[K]` | `str_id` | channel name exactly as in 03-interfaces §14, e.g. `"node.tx"` |
| 2 | `u16[K]` | `channel_id` | numeric id used in `Event` (§3.6.2) |
| 3 | `u8[K]` | `visibility` | `0` GT, `1` NODE, `2` PUBLIC, `3` MIXED, `4` DERIVED, `5` META |
| 4 | `u8[K]` | `enabled` | `1` if the server will emit it now (see `events.set`) |

The table lists every channel the server *can* emit on this connection. In the `node` profile, channels
with visibility `GT` MUST be omitted entirely.

#### 3.1.6 World reference (16 bytes)

| @ | Size | Type | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `u8` | `mode` | `0` HTTP GET by content hash (**default**), `1` inline `WorldChunk` frames, `2` client already has it |
| 1 | 1 | `u8` | `format` | `0` `vwp-world/1` binary (`.vwb`), `1` `vwp-world/1` JSON |
| 2 | 2 | `u16` | `reserved` | 0 |
| 4 | 4 | `u32` | `payload_bytes` | total size of the world payload |
| 8 | 4 | `u32` | `str_url` | path or absolute URL, e.g. `"/world/<64 hex>.vwb"` |
| 12 | 4 | `u32` | `reserved32` | 0 |

**`DECISION`: the world is fetched over HTTP GET by content hash, not streamed.** It is immutable, it is
large (a 1 km² downtown is 1–5 MB), it is shared between runs, and the browser cache plus
`immutable` + `ETag` makes a second run of the same world free. Streaming it would serialise the world
behind the telemetry stream and re-send it on every reconnect. `mode = 1` (`WorldChunk`, §3.9) exists only
for static/WASM hosting where there is no engine HTTP server (09-ui §9).

#### 3.1.7 Symbol table

A `StrTable` (§2.5) at `off_strings`. Establishes string ids `0..n-1`.

### 3.2 Pose quantisation (normative, used by `Keyframe` and `Delta`)

| Quantity | Wire type | Scale | Range | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| absolute x, y | `i32` | millimetres, relative to `Keyframe.origin_{x,y}_m` | ±2,147,483 m | 1 mm |
| absolute z | `i16` | centimetres, relative to `Keyframe.origin_z_m` | ±327.67 m | 1 cm |
| delta x, y, z | `i16` | millimetres, relative to the same field in the **previously delivered frame of the GOP** | ±32.767 m per step | 1 mm |
| heading | `u16` | binary radians (brad): `rad = brad · 2π / 65536` | full turn | 0.0055° |
| speed | `i16` | 1/128 m/s | ±255.99 m/s | 7.8 mm/s |
| acceleration | `i16` | 1/64 m/s² | ±511.98 m/s² | 15.6 mm/s² |
| signal time-to-change | `u16` | deciseconds | 0–6553.4 s | 100 ms |

**`DECISION`: absolute positions are `i32` millimetres relative to a per-keyframe origin, *not* `i16`
millimetres.** ADR 0008 says "int16 millimetres on a per-keyframe origin", which is exactly right for
*deltas* (an actor at 130 km/h moves 3.6 m per 100 ms step, well inside ±32.767 m) but impossible for
*keyframes*: `i16` mm spans ±32.767 m, so it cannot address a 1 km² world from one origin. The ADR's
intent — 1 mm precision and ~10 bytes of pose per actor — is preserved: a keyframe row is 28 B raw
(≈ 280 KB for 10,000 actors, ≈ 60–90 KB after zstd, comfortably inside §7.1's 4 MiB chunk target) and a delta
row is 20 B.

**`DECISION`: world geometry is `f32` ENU metres; actor poses are `i32` millimetres.** `f32` has a 24-bit
mantissa, so at 1 km from the origin its ulp is 1000·2⁻²³ ≈ **0.12 mm**, and at 10 km ≈ 1.2 mm. The often
quoted "f32 gives 0.1 m" applies to *projected absolute* coordinates (UTM eastings ≈ 5×10⁵ m → ulp ≈ 6 cm),
which we never put on the wire: everything is world-local ENU about a `f64` geodetic origin carried in
`Hello`. `f32` is therefore ample for geometry a renderer consumes, and integer millimetres are used for
poses so that quantisation is exact and reproducible rather than rounding-mode dependent.

**`DECISION`: heading is `u16` binary radians, not `f32` radians and not `i16`.** Binary radians wrap
correctly by construction (no ±π branch), cost 2 bytes, and 0.0055° is two orders of magnitude finer than
anything a renderer or a plausibility detector needs. Unsigned removes the sign-extension question.

Normative quantisation rule (both endpoints MUST implement it identically):

```
q(v, scale) = clamp(round_half_away_from_zero(v * scale), TYPE_MIN, TYPE_MAX)
heading_brad = ((round_half_away_from_zero(rad * 65536 / (2π)) % 65536) + 65536) % 65536
```

**Delta reference rule.** A `Delta` position field is the difference against the value **as previously
transmitted and quantised**, never against the engine's unquantised state. The server keeps the quantised
pose of each slot as its reference. Consequence: quantisation error does not accumulate across a GOP, and
a client that applies keyframe + all deltas in order reproduces the server's quantised state exactly.

**Escape hatch.** If a step's `|dx|`, `|dy|` or `|dz|` would exceed 32,000 mm (teleport, `run.seek`,
mobility command, a spawn-adjacent jump), the server MUST set `MFLAG_ABSOLUTE` on that row and put the
absolute pose in the delta's absolute block (§3.4.3) instead. There is no failure mode.

---

### 3.3 `Keyframe` (`0x0002`)

Body = **prefix (64 B)** ‖ actor block ‖ signal block.

#### 3.3.1 Prefix (64 bytes)

| @ | Size | Type | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `u64` | `sim_time_ns` | a mobility-step boundary |
| 8 | 8 | `f64` | `origin_x_m` | quantisation origin |
| 16 | 8 | `f64` | `origin_y_m` | |
| 24 | 8 | `f64` | `origin_z_m` | |
| 32 | 4 | `u32` | `actor_count` | = slot high-water mark + 1; rows are indexed **by slot** |
| 36 | 4 | `u32` | `signal_count` | |
| 40 | 4 | `u32` | `off_actors` | |
| 44 | 4 | `u32` | `off_signals` | |
| 48 | 4 | `u32` | `gop_index` | keyframe ordinal from 0; deltas quote it |
| 52 | 2 | `u16` | `profile` | `0` full, `1` node-only |
| 54 | 2 | `u16` | `reserved` | 0 |
| 56 | 8 | `u64` | `reserved64` | 0 |

**`DECISION`: `origin_{x,y,z}_m` is constant for the whole run and equals `floor(bbox_min)` per axis
(`origin_z_m = 0`).** `i32` mm reaches ±2,147 km from it, so re-centring is never needed; the field stays
per-keyframe so a later minor version can re-centre without a format change. A client MUST read it from
each keyframe rather than caching it from `Hello`.

**`DECISION`: actor rows are a dense array indexed by slot, not a list keyed by actor id.** The UI writes
poses into `SharedArrayBuffer` rings "keyed by actor slot" (09-ui §2); a dense array makes that a
`TypedArray.set()`. Empty slots carry `actor_id = 0xFFFFFFFF` and zeros elsewhere. Slots are assigned by
the server at spawn as the lowest free slot (deterministic), and are released one full keyframe period
after despawn so that a late delta cannot be misapplied.

#### 3.3.2 Actor block (`actor_count = A`, 28·A bytes, 4-aligned)

| # | Type | Column | Unit / meaning | Vis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[A]` | `actor_id` | `ActorId`; `0xFFFFFFFF` = empty slot | PUBLIC |
| 2 | `i32[A]` | `x_mm` | mm east of `origin_x_m` | PUBLIC |
| 3 | `i32[A]` | `y_mm` | mm north of `origin_y_m` | PUBLIC |
| 4 | `u32[A]` | `lane_id` | `LaneId`, `0xFFFFFFFF` = off-lane/unknown | **GT** |
| 5 | `i16[A]` | `z_cm` | cm up from `origin_z_m` | PUBLIC |
| 6 | `u16[A]` | `heading_brad` | binary radians, ENU, 0 = east, CCW | PUBLIC |
| 7 | `i16[A]` | `speed_cq` | 1/128 m/s along `heading` | PUBLIC |
| 8 | `i16[A]` | `accel_cq` | 1/64 m/s², longitudinal | **GT** |
| 9 | `u8[A]` | `class_idx` | index into the class table | PUBLIC |
| 10 | `u8[A]` | `state` | §3.3.4 | mixed |
| 11 | `u8[A]` | `verified_neighbors` | count of neighbours in state *verified*, saturating at 255 | NODE |
| 12 | `u8[A]` | `lamps` | §3.3.5 (v1.2; `flags8`, reserved, in v1.0) | PUBLIC |

**The pose is the body's centre.** `x_mm`/`y_mm`/`z_cm` locate the centre of the class's
bounding box (§4 class table `length_m` × `width_m`), not the kinematic reference point the
recording's `gt.kinematics` carries (the rear-axle reference, taken at the rear bumper). The
server moves it half the class's length forward along `heading_brad`, so a client draws the
body centred on the pose. A recording read directly keeps the reference point.

#### 3.3.3 Signal block (`signal_count = S`, 8·S bytes, 4-aligned)

| # | Type | Column | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[S]` | `signal_id` | the signal **group**: `(SignalId + 1) · 65536 + group`, where `group` is the §4.5 head row's `group`; a value below 65536 is a plain `SignalId` and applies to every head of that controller |
| 2 | `u16[S]` | `time_to_change_ds` | deciseconds to the next phase change, `0xFFFF` unknown |
| 3 | `u8[S]` | `phase` | SAE J2735 `MovementPhaseState`: `0` unavailable, `1` dark, `2` stop-then-proceed, `3` stop-and-remain, `4` pre-movement, `5` permissive-movement-allowed, `6` protected-movement-allowed, `7` permissive-clearance, `8` protected-clearance, `9` caution-conflicting-traffic |
| 4 | `u8[S]` | `reserved` | 0 |

Signals are PUBLIC: a vehicle sees the head with its eyes.

A group's `phase` is the most permissive state among the movements whose approach lane carries
one of its heads (a head over an approach shows the through movement's green while the left turn
from it is permissive), and `time_to_change_ds` is the time to that **group's** next change. One
state per controller cannot be drawn: a crossroads' two head groups show different colours at
every instant of its cycle. (`v2xw_world::signal_group_wire_id` computes the id; the renderer
keys each head row by both its group id and its plain controller id.)

#### 3.3.4 The `state` byte

| Bit | Mask | Name | Meaning | Vis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x01` | `ST_ATTACKER` | the actor is running an `Attacker` plug-in right now | **GT** |
| 1 | `0x02` | `ST_REPORTED` | ≥ 1 misbehaviour report naming this actor has reached the MA | NODE |
| 2 | `0x04` | `ST_REVOKED` | on a published CRL / blocklist (05-protocols stage `published`) | PUBLIC |
| 3 | `0x08` | `ST_EQUIPPED` | carries an OBU or VRU device | PUBLIC |
| 4 | `0x10` | `ST_TRANSMITTING` | transmitted at least once in the last mobility step | NODE |
| 5 | `0x20` | `ST_PARKED` | parked / radio off (06-node-models §2.5) | PUBLIC |
| 6 | `0x40` | `ST_GNSS_DEGRADED` | GNSS fix worse than 3D, or an active outage/jam | NODE |
| 7 | `0x80` | `ST_WARNING_ACTIVE` | a safety application on this node is warning | NODE |

This is the "benign / attacker / reported / revoked" state the palette of 09-ui §10 renders: benign =
none of bits 0–2 set.

#### 3.3.5 The `lamps` byte (v1.2)

What the actor's exterior lamps show. PUBLIC: anyone at the roadside can see a car's lamps, so the
`node` profile carries it unchanged. It lives in bytes a v1.0 reader was already required to ignore —
the keyframe's `flags8` column and the moved and spawn rows' `reserved` byte — so it is a MINOR addition
(§8.5); a v1.0 reader draws every vehicle dark, which is what v1.0 streams said.

| Bit | Mask | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x01` | `LAMP_BRAKE` | stop lamps lit: the driver is on the service brake, or holding the vehicle at a standstill |
| 1 | `0x02` | `LAMP_TURN_LEFT` | left direction indicator operating |
| 2 | `0x04` | `LAMP_TURN_RIGHT` | right direction indicator operating |
| 3 | `0x08` | `LAMP_HAZARD` | hazard warning (both indicators) |
| 4 | `0x10` | `LAMP_LOW_BEAM` | dipped headlamps (and so tail lamps) on |
| 5 | `0x20` | `LAMP_REVERSE` | reversing lamps |
| 6 | `0x40` | `LAMP_EMERGENCY` | an emergency vehicle's warning beacons in use (J2735 `LightbarInUse`) |
| 7 | `0x80` | — | reserved, 0 |

The bits follow SAE J2735's `ExteriorLights` (low beam, left and right turn signal, hazard) and
`BrakeSystemStatus`. An indicator bit means "the indicator is on", not the flash phase: the stream runs
at the mobility step and a flasher at 1–2 Hz (SAE J590), so the client flashes it. The engine's rules are
on the `mobility/lamps/exterior` model card (`v2xw_mobility::lamps`) and in `v2xw_engine::daylight` for
the headlamps; this build produces no hazard or reversing lamp, because no vehicle in it breaks down,
double-parks or reverses. A change of `lamps` alone makes a moved row (§3.4.2): a car standing at a red
releases its brake a step before it moves. `gt.kinematics` carries the same byte as `lamps` (omitted when
zero), which is how the live server's stream gets it.

The writer still announces `version_minor` 0: raising it moves the §9 worked examples, whose `Hello`
bytes carry the minor, and is left to the release that re-blesses them.

---

### 3.4 `Delta` (`0x0003`)

Body = **prefix (64 B)** ‖ moved ‖ absolute ‖ lanes ‖ spawns ‖ despawns ‖ signals.

A `Delta` is meaningful **only** when applied to the state produced by its GOP's `Keyframe` followed by
every earlier `Delta` of the same GOP in `step_index` order. A client that sees a `seq` gap, or a
`gop_index` it did not receive a keyframe for, MUST drop deltas until the next `Keyframe`.

#### 3.4.1 Prefix (64 bytes)

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `u64` | `sim_time_ns` |
| 8 | 4 | `u32` | `gop_index` — must equal the current keyframe's |

#### 3.4.2 Moved block (20·M bytes, 4-aligned)

| # | Type | Column | Meaning | Vis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[M]` | `slot` | strictly ascending | PUBLIC |
| 2 | `i16[M]` | `dx_mm` | change since the previous frame of the GOP | PUBLIC |
| 3 | `i16[M]` | `dy_mm` | | PUBLIC |

| 5 | `u16[M]` | `heading_brad` | **absolute** | PUBLIC |
| 6 | `i16[M]` | `speed_cq` | **absolute**, 1/128 m/s | PUBLIC |
| 7 | `i16[M]` | `accel_cq` | **absolute**, 1/64 m/s² | **GT** |
| 8 | `u8[M]` | `state` | absolute, §3.3.4 | mixed |
| 9 | `u8[M]` | `verified_neighbors` | absolute | NODE |
| 10 | `u8[M]` | `mflags` | §3.4.2.1 | — |
| 11 | `u8[M]` | `lamps` | absolute, §3.3.5 (v1.2; `reserved` in v1.0) | PUBLIC |

Only actors whose quantised pose, `state`, `verified_neighbors`, `lamps` (v1.2) or lane changed appear. Heading, speed,
acceleration, state and neighbour count are absolute because they are already 1–2 bytes: delta-coding them
would save nothing and cost a reference.

##### 3.4.2.1 `mflags`

| Bit | Mask | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x01` | `MFLAG_ABSOLUTE` | ignore `dx/dy/dz`; this row has an entry in the absolute block |
| 1 | `0x02` | `MFLAG_LANE_CHANGED` | this row has an entry in the lane block |
| 2–7 | — | reserved | 0 |

#### 3.4.3 Absolute block (12·`abs_count` bytes, 4-aligned)

Entries appear in the same order as the moved rows that set `MFLAG_ABSOLUTE`, as an **array of structs**:

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `i32` | `x_mm` (relative to the GOP keyframe's origin) |
| 4 | 4 | `i32` | `y_mm` |
| 8 | 2 | `i16` | `z_cm` |
| 10 | 2 | `u16` | `reserved` = 0 |

#### 3.4.4 Lane block (4·`lane_count` bytes) — **GT**

`u32[lane_count] lane_id`, in the order of the moved rows that set `MFLAG_LANE_CHANGED`. Under the `node`
profile this block MUST be absent (`lane_count = 0`, `off_lanes = 0`) and `MFLAG_LANE_CHANGED` MUST be
clear.

#### 3.4.5 Spawn block (36·P bytes, 4-aligned)

| # | Type | Column | Meaning | Vis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[P]` | `slot` | newly occupied slot | PUBLIC |

### 3.5 `Telemetry` (`0x0004`)

Body = **prefix (32 B)** ‖ records.

**`DECISION`: telemetry is an array of structs with a wire-carried `record_size`, unlike poses which are
struct-of-arrays.** The HUD and the inspector read *one node at a time* (09-ui §5), the batch is small
(subscribed nodes only, tens not thousands), and AoS + `record_size` gives the cheapest forward-compatible
extension path (§8).

#### 3.5.1 Prefix (32 bytes)

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `u64` | `sim_time_ns` — end of the sampling window |
| 8 | 8 | `u64` | `window_ns` — length of the sampling window |

#### 3.5.2 `NodeTelemetry` record — 208 bytes

Complete realisation of 06-node-models §2.4 plus the HUD of 09-ui §5. All rate/count fields are measured
over `window_ns`.

### 3.6 `Event` (`0x0005`)

A batch of typed records on the channels of 03-interfaces §14.

Body = **prefix (32 B)** ‖ index ‖ payload region.

#### 3.6.1 Prefix (32 bytes)

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `u64` | `t_start_ns` — inclusive lower bound of the batch |
| 8 | 8 | `u64` | `t_end_ns` — inclusive upper bound |
| 16 | 4 | `u32` | `event_count` (E) |
| 20 | 4 | `u32` | `off_index` — MUST be 8-aligned |
| 24 | 4 | `u32` | `off_payloads` — MUST be 8-aligned |
| 28 | 4 | `u32` | `payload_bytes` |

Index block (16·E bytes, 8-aligned), struct-of-arrays, **sorted by `(sim_time_ns, channel_id)` ascending**:

| # | Type | Column | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u64[E]` | `sim_time_ns` | |
| 2 | `u32[E]` | `payload_off` | byte offset **relative to `off_payloads`**; MUST be a multiple of 8 |
| 3 | `u16[E]` | `payload_len` | including the padding to 8 |
| 4 | `u16[E]` | `channel_id` | §3.6.2 |

Every payload starts 8-aligned within the payload region and is zero-padded to a multiple of 8. A reader
that does not know a `channel_id` skips it using `payload_len` — this is how new channels are added
without a version bump (§8).

#### 3.6.2 Channel ids

| Id | Channel (03-interfaces §14) | Visibility | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gt.kinematics` | GT | §3.6.11 |
| 2 | `gt.attack.action` | GT | §3.6.12 |
| 3 | `gt.spawn` | GT | (carried in `Delta.spawns`; id reserved for the recording) |

| 61 | `snapshot.delta` | MIXED | delivered as `Delta` frames |
| 70 | `manifest` | META | delivered as `Hello` |

Ids 1–999 are reserved for the core; 1000–65534 are for plug-in channels, announced in `Hello.channels`;
`0xFFFF` is reserved.

Shared conventions for payloads: `node_id`, `msg_id` are `u32`; `msg_id` is run-unique and joins `node.tx`
→ `phy.rx` → `node.verify` → `det.observation`. `digest` fields are `HashedId8` (the low 8 bytes of the
SHA-256 of the certificate, IEEE 1609.2). Times other than the index time are absolute `SimTime`.

#### 3.6.3 `MsgType` enum (used by several payloads)

`0` other, `1` BSM, `2` CAM, `3` DENM, `4` SPaT, `5` MAP, `6` PSM, `7` VAM, `8` CPM, `9` SRM, `10` SSM,

NODE-only outputs").

#### 3.6.10 `proto.revocation` (channel 22) — 32 bytes — **PUBLIC**

One record per (revocation, stage) pair, so `revocation_latency_stage` (08-measurement §2.3) is a
difference of two records' index times.

Stages `0`–`3` name the subject before anything is public; the channel is nevertheless PUBLIC because a
revocation record is the *protocol's* output, not the world's ground truth, and it is what the residual-harm
metrics (08-measurement §2.3) are defined over. Under the `node` profile the server MUST withhold
stages `0`–`4` (see §5.3) and emit only `issued` and later.

### 3.7 `MetricSample` (`0x0006`)

Body = **prefix (32 B)** ‖ samples.

Prefix:

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `u64` | `sim_time_ns` — **end** of the time bin |
| 8 | 8 | `u64` | `bin_width_ns` |
| 16 | 4 | `u32` | `sample_count` (M) |
| 20 | 4 | `u32` | `off_samples` — MUST be 8-aligned |
| 24 | 4 | `u32` | `record_size` — **32** in v1 |
| 28 | 4 | `u32` | `reserved` = 0 |

Sample record (array of structs, 32 bytes):

| @ | Size | Type | Field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `f64` | `value` | the aggregated value |
| 8 | 4 | `u32` | `str_metric` | string id of the `MetricDef.name`, e.g. `"pdr"` |
| 12 | 4 | `u32` | `dim_key` | handle into the dimension dictionary (§3.8); `0` = no dimensions |
| 16 | 4 | `u32` | `node_id` | `0xFFFFFFFF` if not per-node |
| 20 | 4 | `u32` | `count` | number of underlying observations |
| 24 | 2 | `u16` | `agg` | `0` sum, `1` mean, `2` p50, `3` p95, `4` p99, `5` ratio, `6` rate, `7` max, `8` min |

| 27 | 1 | `u8` | `reserved` = 0 | |
| 28 | 4 | `u32` | `prov_id` | provenance id; `0` none |

Units are not on the wire: they come from the `MetricDef`, which the client gets from `metrics.query`
(§6.10) or `rpc.discover`. A sample with `visibility = 0` MUST NOT be emitted in the `node` profile.

---

### 3.8 `Provenance` (`0x0007`)

Resolves the `prov_id` values that appear in `MetricSample` and in several event payloads into
(model id, model version, parameter-set id), so the inspector's "why" tab (09-ui §5, 02-architecture §6.5)
can explain any displayed value without a round trip. It also carries the dimension dictionary used by
`MetricSample.dim_key`.

Body = **prefix (32 B)** ‖ entries ‖ dims ‖ symbol-table extension.

Prefix:

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `u64` | `sim_time_ns` |
| 8 | 4 | `u32` | `entry_count` (P) |

| 20 | 4 | `u32` | `off_dims` |
| 24 | 4 | `u32` | `off_strings` — symbol-table extension, or `0` |
| 28 | 4 | `u32` | `flags` — bit0 `PROV_REPLACE_ALL`, bit1 `PROV_FINAL` (no more will be sent) |

Entry block (24·P bytes, struct-of-arrays):

| # | Type | Column | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[P]` | `prov_id` | non-zero, unique for the run |
| 2 | `u32[P]` | `str_model_id` | e.g. `"radio/propagation/log-distance-shadowing"` |
| 3 | `u32[P]` | `str_model_version` | semver, e.g. `"1.2.0"` |
| 4 | `u32[P]` | `str_param_set_id` | content-addressed parameter-set id, e.g. `"b3:9f2c1e…"` |
| 5 | `u32[P]` | `str_card_url` | URL of the generated model-card page |
| 6 | `u16[P]` | `family` | index into the `family` enum of the model-card schema (03-interfaces §12), in the order listed there |
| 7 | `u16[P]` | `subject_kind` | `0` value, `1` node, `2` link, `3` actor, `4` metric, `5` channel, `6` world |

Dim block (8·Dk bytes):

| # | Type | Column | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[Dk]` | `dim_key` | the handle referenced by `MetricSample.dim_key` |
| 2 | `u32[Dk]` | `str_dims` | canonical `"k=v,k=v"` with keys sorted ASCII-ascending, e.g. `"dist_bin=75,rat=dsrc"` |

Symbol-table extension: a `StrTable` (§2.5) whose entry `i` takes global id `table_size_before + i`.

The server MUST send at least one `Provenance` frame immediately after the first `Keyframe`, covering every
`prov_id` it will reference before the next one. `explain` (§6.9) returns the same information as JSON,
resolved and human-readable.

---

### 3.9 `WorldChunk` (`0x0008`)

Used only when `Hello.world_ref.mode = 1` (static/WASM hosting, no engine HTTP server). Carries the same
bytes an HTTP `GET /world/{hash}.vwb` would return, split into chunks of at most 1 MiB. All chunks but the
last carry `FLAG_CONTINUED`.

Body = **prefix (64 B)** ‖ payload.

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 32 | `u8[32]` | `world_hash` — MUST equal `Hello.world_hash` |
| 32 | 8 | `u64` | `total_bytes` |
| 40 | 4 | `u32` | `chunk_index` — 0-based |
| 44 | 4 | `u32` | `chunk_count` |
| 48 | 4 | `u32` | `off_payload` |
| 52 | 4 | `u32` | `payload_len` |
| 56 | 1 | `u8` | `format` — `0` `vwp-world/1` binary, `1` JSON |
| 57 | 3 | — | reserved = 0 |
| 60 | 4 | `u32` | `reserved32` = 0 |

The client MUST verify `SHA-256(concat(payloads)) == world_hash` and MUST discard the world on mismatch.

---

### 3.10 `Error` (`0x00FE`)

Body = **prefix (32 B)** ‖ symbol-table extension.

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `u64` | `sim_time_ns` |
| 8 | 4 | `i32` | `code` — the same numbering as the JSON-RPC error codes (§6.4) |
| 12 | 4 | `u32` | `off_strings` |
| 16 | 4 | `u32` | `str_message` — one line, human readable |
| 20 | 4 | `u32` | `str_detail` — may be a JSON document as a string |
| 24 | 1 | `u8` | `fatal` — `1` means a `Bye` follows and the socket closes |
| 25 | 3 | — | reserved = 0 |
| 28 | 4 | `u32` | `reserved32` = 0 |

`Error` reports *stream* problems (the engine aborted, a model failed, the resume window was lost).
Problems with a specific control call are reported as JSON-RPC errors on the text channel instead.

### 3.11 `Bye` (`0x00FF`)

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `u64` | `sim_time_ns` |
| 8 | 8 | `u64` | `canonical_frames` — total canonical frames produced for this run |
| 16 | 1 | `u8` | `reason` — `0` run-complete, `1` client-requested, `2` server-shutdown, `3` error, `4` superseded-by-reconnect |
| 17 | 3 | — | reserved = 0 |
| 20 | 4 | `u32` | `off_strings` |
| 24 | 4 | `u32` | `str_detail` |
| 28 | 4 | `u32` | `reserved32` = 0 |

Followed by a symbol-table extension at `off_strings` (may be an empty table). The server closes the
socket with 1000 after sending `Bye` (except reason `4`, which uses 1012).

---
## 4. The world payload — `vwp-world/1`

**`DECISION`: road geometry, lane polylines and building footprints are fetched with one HTTP GET by
content hash, in a flat binary format with the same conventions as §2.** Reason in §3.1.6.

```
GET /world/{64-hex-sha256}.vwb        → application/vnd.v2xw.world.v1
GET /world/{64-hex-sha256}.json       → application/json
```

Both are immutable and cacheable forever. A client that already holds the world for `Hello.world_hash`
skips the fetch entirely — this is what makes a second run of the same scenario start instantly.

### 4.1 File header (16 bytes)

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `u32` | `magic` = `0x444C5756` (wire bytes `56 57 4C 44` = `V W L D`) |
| 4 | 2 | `u16` | `version` = 1 |
| 6 | 2 | `u16` | `reserved` = 0 |
| 8 | 4 | `u32` | `body_len` — uncompressed body bytes |
| 12 | 2 | `u16` | `flags` — bit0 `zstd` |
| 14 | 2 | `u16` | `reserved` = 0 |

Body starts at file offset 16. All body offsets below are body-relative.

### 4.2 Directory prefix (192 bytes)

| @ | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 32 | `u8[32]` | `content_hash` — SHA-256 of the body **with these 32 bytes zeroed** (see the amendment below); MUST equal the URL hash and `Hello.world_hash` |

| 176 | 4 | `u32` | `provenance_json_bytes` |
| 180 | 12 | — | reserved = 0 |

The `bbox` here is authoritative and MUST equal `Hello.bbox_*`.

**Amendment, 2026-09-18 — `content_hash` is computed with its own field zeroed.** As
first written, this row asked for "the SHA-256 of the body" while storing that digest
*inside* the body, which cannot hold literally: changing the field changes the body, and
therefore the digest of the body. The rule, which both existing implementations already
follow independently — the Rust writer (`v2xw-world/src/serde_vwp.rs`) and the TypeScript
client (`ui/packages/protocol`), whose digests agree byte for byte on the 2 MB Manhattan
payload — is:

> A writer MUST zero the 32 bytes at body offset 0, hash the **whole body** including
> those 32 zero bytes, and then write the digest into them. A reader MUST verify by
> copying the body, zeroing the same 32 bytes, and hashing the copy. Nothing else about
> the body changes.

Conformance item W1 (§10.5) is read with this rule: "a body whose SHA-256 equals `{hash}`"
means the body so zeroed. The two `MUST`s in the row above are unchanged: this digest is
the `{hash}` in `GET /world/{hash}.vwb` and the value `Hello.world_hash` carries.

**Recorded defect, 2026-09-18 — §3.1.1's gloss on `Hello.world_hash` contradicts this
row.** §3.1.1 annotates the field as "`World.content_hash` (03-interfaces §2)", which is
the engine's *geometry* digest: a hash of the quantised model, independent of any wire
format, and a different number from the payload digest defined here. §4.2's `MUST`, W1 and
§4's caching rule ("a client that already holds the world for `Hello.world_hash` skips the
fetch entirely" — a statement about a URL key) all require `Hello.world_hash` to be the
**payload** digest, and that is what an implementation MUST send; a server that sends the
geometry digest produces a `Hello` whose `world_hash` resolves to no payload. A future
revision should either rename one of the two fields or carry both, so the ambiguity cannot
be read into it again. The implementation keeps them apart by name: *geometry digest* for
`World::content_hash`, *payload digest* for `WorldPayload::content_hash`.

### 4.3 Lanes (36·`lane_count`, 4-aligned)

Struct-of-arrays:

| # | Type | Column | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[L]` | `lane_id` | `LaneId` |
| 2 | `u32[L]` | `point_off` | index of the first centreline point in the point arrays |
| 3 | `u32[L]` | `point_count` | ≥ 2 |
| 4 | `u32[L]` | `edge_id` | `EdgeId` |
| 5 | `u32[L]` | `junction_id` | `0xFFFFFFFF` unless the lane is internal to a junction |
| 6 | `u32[L]` | `str_name` | street name, may be `""` |
| 7 | `f32[L]` | `width_m` | |
| 8 | `f32[L]` | `speed_limit_mps` | |
| 9 | `u16[L]` | `allowed_classes` | bitmask: `1` car, `2` truck, `4` bus, `8` moto, `16` bicycle, `32` pedestrian, `64` emergency, `128` rail |
| 10 | `u8[L]` | `lane_type` | `0` drive, `1` bike, `2` sidewalk, `3` bus, `4` parking, `5` junction-internal, `6` crossing |
| 11 | `u8[L]` | `index_in_edge` | 0 = rightmost in the direction of travel |

**Lane centrelines** (`off_lane_points`), three parallel `f32` arrays of length `lane_point_total`, 4-aligned:

```
f32[lane_point_total] x_m
f32[lane_point_total] y_m
f32[lane_point_total] z_m
```

Lane `i` uses `x_m[point_off[i] .. point_off[i]+point_count[i]]`. Points are in travel order, in ENU
metres relative to the geodetic origin. Successive points MUST differ by ≥ 1 mm.

**`DECISION`: lane connectivity (`successors`, conflict matrices) is NOT in the world payload.** The UI
never needs it — it renders geometry and follows engine-produced poses — and shipping the lane graph would
roughly double the payload. Tools that need it call `inspect.entity` (§6.8) or read the engine's world
cache directly.

### 4.4 Buildings (28·`building_count`, 4-aligned)

| # | Type | Column | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `u32[B]` | `building_id` | |
| 2 | `u32[B]` | `ring_off` | index of the first point of the outer ring |
| 3 | `u32[B]` | `ring_count` | number of points in the outer ring, ≥ 3 |
| 4 | `f32[B]` | `height_m` | above `base_z_m` |
| 5 | `f32[B]` | `base_z_m` | terrain height at the footprint |
| 6 | `u32[B]` | `str_name` | may be `""` |
| 7 | `u8[B]` | `material` | `0` unknown, `1` concrete, `2` brick, `3` glass, `4` wood, `5` metal |
| 8 | `u8[B]` | `lod_hint` | `0` box, `1` box+roof, `2` detailed |
| 9 | `u16[B]` | `levels` | storeys, `0xFFFF` unknown |

**Ring points** (`off_ring_points`), two parallel `f32` arrays of length `ring_point_total`:

```
f32[ring_point_total] x_m
f32[ring_point_total] y_m
```

Rings are **counter-clockwise**, **not closed** (the renderer closes them), and each point's z is the
building's `base_z_m`. **`DECISION`: v1 stores outer rings only; interior holes are dropped at import and
the drop is recorded in the world provenance.** Holes matter to neither the obstacle model at the tiers
we ship nor the extruded-footprint renderer, and supporting them would need a second indirection.

Landuse zones share these ring arrays.

**Provenance** (`off_provenance_json`, `provenance_json_bytes`): a UTF-8 JSON object, the serialised
`WorldProvenance` of 03-interfaces §2 — `{source, bbox, imported_at, tool_versions, transformations,
licence, dropped}`. It is JSON because it is read once, by a human or a manifest writer.

**Symbol table** (`off_strings`): a `StrTable` (§2.5) scoped to the world file; its ids are independent of
the connection's symbol table.

### 4.6 JSON form

`GET /world/{hash}.json` returns the same content as JSON, for debugging, tests and third-party tools. It
is a direct transcription: each binary section becomes an array of objects, and the parallel `f32` point
arrays become flat number arrays.

```json

The JSON form MUST hash to the same `content_hash` as the binary form (the hash is of the **binary** body;
the JSON carries it for cross-checking, it is not a hash of the JSON).

## 5. Visibility and the `NODE-only` profile

### 5.1 The three tags

Every channel, every `Keyframe`/`Delta` column and every telemetry field carries one of:

| Tag | Meaning | Available in `node` profile |
|---|---|---|
| **GT** | ground truth — knowable only by the simulator, never by a real receiver | **no** |
| **NODE** | what a real node computes or observes from what it received | yes |
| **PUBLIC** | knowable by anyone standing in the street, or published by the protocol | yes |
| MIXED | a record with both GT and NODE columns | yes, with GT columns blanked |
| DERIVED | computed by a metric provider over other channels; inherits the strictest tag of its inputs | yes if its inputs are |
| META | manifest / protocol scaffolding | yes |

### 5.2 The exact GT set

A `node`-profile server MUST NOT emit any of the following. This list is exhaustive for v1; a conformance
test enumerates it.

**Channels (whole channel withheld)**
`gt.kinematics` (1), `gt.attack.action` (2), `gt.spawn` (3), `gt.despawn` (4).

**`Hello`**
- `nodes.flags` bit1 `IS_ATTACKER` MUST be 0.
- GT channels MUST be absent from the channel table (not merely `enabled = 0`).

**`Keyframe` / `Delta`**

| Field | Blanked to |
|---|---|
| `lane_id` (keyframe column 4; spawn column 6) | `0xFFFFFFFF` |
| the whole delta lane block | absent; `lane_count = 0`, `MFLAG_LANE_CHANGED` clear |
| `accel_cq` (keyframe column 8; moved column 7) | `0` |
| `state` bit 0 `ST_ATTACKER` | `0` |
| spawn `cause`, despawn `cause` | `0xFFFF` |
| rows for actors without `ST_EQUIPPED` | the slot is left empty (`actor_id = 0xFFFFFFFF`) |

The last rule is the principled one: an unequipped pedestrian transmits nothing, so no node-visible data
source can know it exists. Equipped actors keep their pose — the viewport needs a scene to draw, and an
equipped actor's position is exactly what its own broadcasts assert. **`DECISION`: the `node` profile
strips labels, identity linkage and truth of a claim; it does not strip the geometry of transmitting
actors. The purpose is blind evaluation of detection and response, not an occlusion simulator.**

**`Telemetry`**

| Field | Blanked to |
|---|---|
| `clock_offset_ns` | `0` |
| `pos_error_m` | `NaN` |
| `node_state` value `6` (compromised) | reported as `2` (active) |

**Event payloads**

| Channel | Field | Blanked to |
|---|---|---|
| `phy.rx` (11) | `tx_node` | `0xFFFFFFFF` |
| `phy.rx` (11) | `distance_m` | `NaN` |
| `phy.rx` (11) | `los_class` | `0xFF` |
| `node.neighbor` (16) | `peer_actor_id` | `0xFFFFFFFF` |
| `det.observation` (30) | `subject_actor_id` | `0xFFFFFFFF` |
| `app.warning` (40) | `truth`, `subject_actor_id` | `0`, `0xFFFFFFFF` |
| `ma.*` (31/32/33) | `subject_actor_id` | `0xFFFFFFFF` |
| `proto.revocation` (22) | records with `stage ≤ 4` | withheld entirely |
| `gt.attack.action` (2) | whole record | withheld |

**`MetricSample`**
Samples whose `visibility` is `0` (GT) are not emitted. This removes `ttc_min`, `pet`, `drac`,
`flow`/`density`/`mean_speed` (GT traffic), `det_precision`/`det_recall`, `time_to_detect`,
`false_accusations`, `linkability_rate`, `tracking_duration`, `residual_harm`, and `nar` (which joins
`phy.rx` with `gt.kinematics`).

### 5.3 Profile mechanics

- The profile is chosen at connect: `?profile=node`. It is **immutable for the connection**; no control
  method can change it. To switch, the client reconnects.
- The server sets `HELLO_NODE_ONLY` in `hello_flags`, `Keyframe.profile = 1`, and `FLAG_NODE_ONLY` on
  every canonical frame.
- Blanking happens at the **producer**, before serialisation, not at the socket. A `node`-profile stream is
  therefore also a valid recording of a blinded run.
- Any control method that would reveal GT returns error `-32040 visibility_denied` with
  `data = {"field": "...", "visibility": "GT"}`. This applies to `events.set` on a GT channel,
  `metrics.query` for a GT metric, `inspect.entity` on an `Attacker` entity, and `explain` on a GT subject.
- A run recorded in `full` can be replayed under `profile=node` (the replay reader blanks on the way out).
  A run recorded under `node` can never be replayed as `full` — the data is not there. `Hello.scenario_hash`
  is unaffected either way, so both are traceable to the same scenario.
- Overlays that render GT (attacker markers, GT position vs belief) MUST be absent from the overlay list
  returned by `overlay.set`'s introspection in the `node` profile (09-ui §6: "ground-truth overlays … can
  be locked off for blind evaluation").

---
## 6. JSON-RPC 2.0 control surface

### 6.1 Framing

Text frames on the same socket carry JSON-RPC 2.0 (single objects only; **`DECISION`: batch requests are
not supported — they complicate ordering against the binary stream and every real caller sends one call at
a time**; a server receiving a JSON array MUST reply `-32600`).

- `id` is a string or integer chosen by the client; the server echoes it.
- Requests without `id` are notifications; the server MUST NOT reply.
- The server also *sends* notifications (never requests) — see §6.14.
- Control calls and binary frames are **not** ordered with respect to each other except as stated per
  method (`run.seek` and `run.step` define their own ordering guarantee).

### 6.2 JSON-RPC over HTTP

`POST /rpc` with `Content-Type: application/json` accepts the same methods and returns the same results,
for CLI, notebooks and CI. Methods that are connection-scoped (`view.follow`, `view.camera`,
`overlay.set`) return `-32009 not_supported_on_http`. This is the surface the Python API and the generated
CLI (02-architecture §12) are built on.

### 6.3 Self-description

`rpc.discover` returns an **OpenRPC 1.3.2** document describing every method with its params schema,
result schema, errors, summary and examples. **`DECISION`: OpenRPC, not a bespoke registry — it is the
standard self-description format for JSON-RPC, and the copilot's tool registry (09-ui §6/§8) can be
generated from it mechanically, as can the CLI and the typed Python stubs.**

The document is also served statically at `GET /rpc/schema`. Every schema in this section is a fragment of
it. `rpc.discover` MUST be implemented by every server.

### 6.4 Error codes

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| −32700 | `parse_error` | invalid JSON |
| −32600 | `invalid_request` | not a valid JSON-RPC 2.0 request object |
| −32601 | `method_not_found` | |

| −32010 | `busy` | another long operation holds the run; `data = {"operation": "...", "job_id": "..."}` |
| −32011 | `experiment_not_found` | |
| −32012 | `plugin_drift` | replay refuses a different plug-in hash (02-architecture §8) |
| −32013 | `io_error` | file system / network failure; `data = {"path": "...", "errno": "..."}` |
| −32040 | `visibility_denied` | the `node` profile forbids this; `data = {"field","visibility"}` |
| −32041 | `unauthorized` | |
| −32042 | `rate_limited` | `data = {"retry_after_ms": 500}` |

### 6.6 Run control

#### `run.start`

Loads a scenario (or the already-set one) and begins producing the stream.

```json
{"params": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,
  "properties": {
    "scenario":  {"oneOf":[{"type":"string","description":"path or preset id"},
                           {"type":"object","description":"inline scenario document (schema v2xw/scenario/1)"}]},
    "seed":      {"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"overrides scenario.seed"},
    "speed":     {"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":100,
                  "description":"0 = as fast as possible; absent keeps the speed the run has now"},
    "paused":    {"type":"boolean","default":false,"description":"start paused at t=0"},
    "record":    {"type":"boolean","default":true,"description":"write the MCAP recording"},
    "record_path": {"type":"string"},
    "label":     {"type":"string","maxLength":120}}},
 "result": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,
  "required":["run_id","state","world_hash","scenario_hash"],
  "properties": {
    "run_id":        {"$ref":"#/$defs/RunId"},
    "state":         {"$ref":"#/$defs/RunState"},
    "world_hash":    {"$ref":"#/$defs/Sha256Hex"},
    "scenario_hash": {"$ref":"#/$defs/Sha256Hex"},
    "recording_path":{"type":"string"},
    "t_end_ns":      {"$ref":"#/$defs/SimTimeNs"}}},
 "errors": [-32001, -32004, -32005, -32013]}
```

The server sends a fresh `Hello` on this connection before the first `Keyframe` of the new run.

#### `run.pause`

```json
{"params": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"properties":{}},
 "result": {"type":"object","required":["state","t_ns"],"additionalProperties":false,
            "properties":{"state":{"$ref":"#/$defs/RunState"},"t_ns":{"$ref":"#/$defs/SimTimeNs"}}},
 "errors": [-32002]}
```

Pausing is at the next mobility-step boundary; the reply's `t_ns` is that boundary. The server MUST have
sent every frame up to and including `t_ns` before replying.

#### `run.resume`

Identical params/result to `run.pause`. Errors: `-32002` if not paused.

#### `run.step`

```json
{"params": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,
  "properties": {"unit":  {"enum":["step","event","keyframe","second"],"default":"step"},
                 "count": {"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":100000,"default":1}}},
 "result": {"type":"object","required":["state","t_ns","stepped"],"additionalProperties":false,
  "properties": {"state":{"$ref":"#/$defs/RunState"},"t_ns":{"$ref":"#/$defs/SimTimeNs"},
                 "stepped":{"type":"integer"},
                 "last_event":{"type":"object","description":"present when unit=event",
                   "properties":{"channel":{"$ref":"#/$defs/ChannelName"},
                                 "priority":{"type":"integer"},"seq":{"type":"integer"}}}}},
 "errors": [-32002]}
```

`unit: "event"` steps the DES event heap one event at a time using the `(time, priority, seq)` order of
02-architecture §5.1 — that is what the "step one event" control of 09-ui §6 means. The server MUST flush
all frames produced by the step before replying.

#### `run.seek`

```json
{"params": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,
  "oneOf": [{"required":["t_ns"]}, {"required":["fraction"]}, {"required":["event"]}],

```

Ordering guarantee: the server MUST send the `Keyframe` (with `FLAG_SEEK_RESULT | FLAG_RESYNC`) and all
deltas up to `t_ns` **before** the JSON-RPC reply. A client can therefore treat the reply as "the scene is
now at `t_ns`". Live runs support `run.seek` only when `HELLO_SEEKABLE` is set; seeking a live run
pauses it. **`DECISION` (2026-09-23): a live run seeks forward too.** A live kernel computes only a
bounded distance ahead of the stream; a target past what it has produced, but inside the run, is reached
by letting the kernel run there first. While it does, the server sends `job.progress`
`{"job_id":"run.seek:<t_ns>","progress","message","t_ns","target_ns"}` on the calling connection (§6.14),
then `job.done`, then the frames and the reply as above. A client should allow such a call longer than
its usual timeout. `-32003` then means only that the run ended before `t_ns`.

#### `run.speed`

 "errors": [-32002, -32008]}
```

The run stops: its kernel is stopped and joined before the reply, and `run.state {state: "finished"}` goes to every connection. **`DECISION` (2026-09-23): the connection stays open** — the page that pressed Stop needs a socket to press Run on, and `run.start` on it sends the next run's `Hello` (below). Earlier drafts had the server send `Bye{reason = 1}` and close here.

#### `run.status`

### 6.7 View control (connection-scoped)

#### `view.follow`

```json
{"params": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,
  "properties": {
    "node":   {"$ref":"#/$defs/NodeId"},
    "actor":  {"$ref":"#/$defs/ActorId"},
    "camera": {"$ref":"#/$defs/CameraMode"},
    "clear":  {"type":"boolean","default":false},
    "telemetry": {"type":"boolean","default":true,
                  "description":"subscribe this node to Telemetry frames"},
    "radius_m": {"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":5000,"default":0,
                 "description":"also subscribe nodes within this radius"}}},
 "result": {"type":"object","required":["following","subscribed_nodes"],"additionalProperties":false,
  "properties": {"following":{"type":["integer","null"]},
                 "camera":{"$ref":"#/$defs/CameraMode"},
                 "subscribed_nodes":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/$defs/NodeId"}}}},
 "errors": [-32006, -32009]}
```

`view.follow` is the subscription control for `Telemetry`: the server sends telemetry only for subscribed
nodes, which is what keeps the telemetry frame small.

#### 6.7.1 The followed node's message feed (v1.1)

`view.follow` takes one more optional parameter, and its result one more optional member:

```json
{"params": {"feed": {"oneOf": [{"type": "boolean"},
   {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false,
    "properties": {"sent": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 200, "default": 20},
                   "received": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 500, "default": 40},
                   "waiting": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 100, "default": 8},
                   "bytes": {"type": "boolean", "default": true},
                   "hz": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0.2, "maximum": 20, "default": 4}}}]}},
 "result": {"feed": {"type": "object", "required": ["v"],
   "properties": {"v": {"const": 1}, "available": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"},
                  "hz": {}, "sent": {}, "received": {}, "waiting": {}, "bytes": {}}}}}
```

`feed: true` (or an object of limits) subscribes the followed node to `node.feed` (§6.14); `false` drops the
subscription; absent leaves it as it is. The subscription belongs to the followed node: following another
node or `clear` drops it. An engine with no feed (the fixture, a replay) answers `available: false` with a
reason and pushes nothing.

While subscribed the server sends `node.feed` once immediately after the reply (the node's kept history,
`reset: true`) and then at most `hz` times per wall-clock second, each push carrying what the node put on
the air and what it resolved since the previous push (`since_ns` → `t_ns`), newest first, at most `sent` and
`received` of each, with the number left out in `omitted`. The pacing is the transport's (§1.5's kind of
wall time) and moves no simulated value. After a backward seek the next push starts over (`reset: true`).

Every decoded value is read from the frame's own octets. The engine hands the server each transmitted
SPDU (`RunRecorder::tap_frame`, not a record: nothing recorded or digested changes); the server parses
the IEEE 1609.2 envelope with the same parser a receiving node verifies with and the payload with the
J2735 BSM or ETSI CAM decoder. A field carried as its data element's "unavailable" value arrives as
`{"v": null, "na": true, "raw": <the sentinel>}`. `decoded.spans` tile `[0, spdu_bytes)`: the 1609.2
header, the payload, `headerInfo`, the signer and the signature.

A `node.feed` push:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `v` | the feed schema version, `1`; a reader refuses another |
| `node`, `t_ns`, `since_ns`, `reset` | whose feed, the stream instant it covers, the previous push's instant |
| `sent[]` | `msg`, `t_ns` (on the air), `type`, `bytes` (on_wire, payload, envelope, certificate, network, link), `radio` (power, channel, airtime), `signer`, `pseudonym` (HashedId8), `timing` (generated, sign start, signed; sign-queue, signing and channel-access ms), `decoded` |
| `received[]` | `msg`, `t_ns` (resolved), `type`, `outcome` (`delivered`/`lost`/`in-flight`), `cause`, `verification`, `rssi_dbm`, `sinr_db`, `bytes_on_wire`, `e2e_ms`, `stages_ms` (the 10 stages of `node.rx`'s decomposition), `from` and `dist_m` (**GT**: absent on a `node`-profile connection), `decoded` (delivered only) |
| `omitted`, `shed`, `undetected` | new entries the push bound left out; entries the server's per-node cap shed; attempts the receiver never detected (`out-of-range`, `below-sensitivity`), counted and not listed |
| `history_ns` | how far behind the stream the server keeps a node's traffic (20 s) |
| `queues` | the five queues of 03-interfaces §8 (`rx`, `verify`, `app`, `tx`, `crl`): `depth` at the instant, `peak` during the last step, `in_service`, `served` and `wait_p50_ms`/`wait_p95_ms` over the last second, `drops` by cause over the last ten seconds, `waiting[]` (every message that waited during the last step: `msg`, `type`, `from`, `enqueued_ns`, `left_ns` or `null`, `waited_ms`, `stage`), `reported_depth` (the node's own telemetry window), plus `step_ms` and `kernel_lead_ms` |

The queues are reconstructed from the node's own `node.tx`/`node.rx` stamps, so they are the node model's
instants, not a second model. A reading covers the whole last step because the stream is drawn on the step
grid and a vehicle's traffic is periodic at the same period: read only at the instant, a queue that is busy
every step can read empty forever. The CRL task queue has no per-task stamps; its `depth` is `null` and its
`reported_depth` is the node's telemetry window. A message still queued at the instant is known only once
the kernel has run past the moment it leaves; `kernel_lead_ms` says how far that is.

`docs/protocol/vectors/node-feed-v1.json` is a captured push. `crates/v2xw-server/tests/feed.rs` fails when
the server's push stops having exactly its shape, and `@vwp/protocol`'s `test/feed.test.ts` checks the
TypeScript definitions against the same file.

#### `view.camera`

```json
{"params": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"required":["mode"],
  "properties": {
    "mode":     {"$ref":"#/$defs/CameraMode"},
    "target":   {"$ref":"#/$defs/Vec3"},

    "projection": {"enum":["perspective","orthographic"],"default":"perspective"},
    "extent_m": {"type":"number","minimum":1,"description":"map mode: ground extent to cover"},
    "node":     {"$ref":"#/$defs/NodeId","description":"for mode rsu|jump"},
    "animate_ms": {"type":"integer","minimum":0,"maximum":10000,"default":800}}},
 "result": {"type":"object","required":["mode","position","target","fov_deg","projection"],

                 "fov_deg":{"type":"number"},"projection":{"enum":["perspective","orthographic"]}}},
 "errors": [-32006, -32602, -32009]}
```

The camera lives in the client; the method exists so a copilot, a notebook or a CI screenshot job can drive
it (09-ui §8). The server forwards it to the owning client as a `view.changed` notification and echoes the
resolved state.

#### `overlay.set`

```json
{"params": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,
  "properties": {
    "overlays": {"type":"object","additionalProperties":{"type":"boolean"},
      "propertyNames": {"enum": ["tx_pulses","links","cbr_heatmap","coverage","attackers_gt",
                                 "revoked","reported","detections","backend_flows","focus_region",
                                 "lane_markings","buildings","labels","trajectories_gt",
                                 "belief_vs_truth_gt","signal_state","rsu_range","density"]}},
    "opacity":  {"type":"object","additionalProperties":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},
    "list":     {"type":"boolean","default":false,"description":"return the catalogue and do nothing else"}}},
 "result": {"type":"object","required":["overlays"],"additionalProperties":false,
  "properties": {"overlays":{"type":"object","additionalProperties":{"type":"boolean"}},
                 "catalogue":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object",
                   "required":["name","visibility","available"],
                   "properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},
                                 "visibility":{"$ref":"#/$defs/Visibility"},
                                 "available":{"type":"boolean"},
                                 "description":{"type":"string"},
                                 "needs_channels":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/$defs/ChannelName"}}}}}}},
 "errors": [-32040, -32602]}
```

Overlays whose name ends in `_gt` have `visibility: "GT"`; in the `node` profile they are reported with
`available: false` and enabling them returns `-32040`.

```

This is the HUD and inspector payload of 09-ui §5, as JSON, on demand.

`messages` (added with the metrics track, 2026-09-23) is the node's recent traffic oldest first, each entry
with the members of §6.7.1's `sent[]` and `received[]` plus the original flat names (`msg_type`,
`bytes_on_wire`, `payload_bytes`, `content`, …); `queues` answers with §6.7.1's queue reading. Both come
from the same store as `node.feed`, and on a `node`-profile connection `messages.received[]` carries no
`from` or `dist_m` (§5.2).

### 6.9 `explain`

```

**`DECISION`: any method that can exceed 2 s returns a `Job` instead of a final result, and reports
progress with the `job.progress` / `job.done` notifications (§6.14), rather than holding the socket open.**
An import that completes inside 2 s returns the `WorldImportResult` directly; a longer one returns a `Job`
whose `job.done` notification carries the same object in `outputs[0]` and whose `world_hash` can then be
read from a repeat call with identical params (imports are content-addressed, so the repeat is free).

```

**`DECISION`: no event channel is subscribed by default.** A dense scenario produces millions of
`phy.rx` records per simulated second; sending them unasked would swamp any client. The Studio subscribes
`app.warning`, `det.observation`, `proto.revocation` and `sec.cert` at start-up, and subscribes the
high-rate channels only for the followed node.

### 6.14 Server → client notifications

The server sends these as JSON-RPC notifications (no `id`, no reply expected).

| Method | Params | When |
|---|---|---|
| `run.state` | `{"state","t_ns","run_id","reason"?}` | any run state transition not caused by the caller |
| `stream.drop` | `{"seq_first","seq_last","dropped":{…},"resync_seq"}` | after a backpressure drop (§1.5) |
| `job.progress` | `{"job_id","progress","message"}` | long operations (import, export, experiment) |
| `job.done` | `{"job_id","state","outputs","error"?}` | long operation finished |
| `view.changed` | `{"mode","position","target","fov_deg","following"}` | another client or the copilot moved the camera |
| `log` | `{"level","target","message","t_ns"?}` | `tracing` events at or above the connection's level |
| `validation` | `{"errors":[…],"warnings":[…]}` | the scenario changed and was re-validated |
| `experiment.progress` | `{"experiment_id","cells_done","cells_total","eta_s"}` | during `experiment.run` |
| `node.feed` (v1.1) | §6.7.1 | while `view.follow {feed}` stands for the followed node |

### 6.15 Method inventory

32 methods plus `rpc.discover` = **33**. (`scenario.schema` was added on 2026-09-23 with the
generated settings surface, 13-product-direction §2: every scenario field with its unit, default,
range, description and implementation status. It is a property of the build, not of a run.)

| Group | Methods |
|---|---|
| run (8) | `run.start`, `run.pause`, `run.resume`, `run.step`, `run.seek`, `run.speed`, `run.stop`, `run.status` |
| view (3) | `view.follow`, `view.camera`, `overlay.set` |
| inspect (4) | `inspect.node`, `inspect.link`, `inspect.entity`, `explain` |
| scenario (7) | `scenario.get`, `scenario.set`, `scenario.validate`, `scenario.save`, `scenario.load`, `scenario.list`, `scenario.schema` |
| world (2) | `world.import_osm`, `world.generate` |
| stream (1) | `events.set` |
| metrics (2) | `metrics.query`, `metrics.plot` |
| export (2) | `export.dataset`, `export.recording` |
| experiment (3) | `experiment.define`, `experiment.run`, `experiment.status` |
| meta (1) | `rpc.discover` |

Reserved for later minor versions, listed in 09-ui §8 but out of scope for v1:
`world.import_sumo`, `world.edit`, `metrics.export`, `experiment.compare`, `export.traces`,
`export.telemetry`, `foundry.run`. Adding them is a minor-version change (§8).

## 7. Replay

### 7.1 Recording layout

The recording is MCAP (ADR 0008). Mapping:

| MCAP concept | VWP |
|---|---|
| Channel | one per VWP message type plus one per event channel: `vwp/hello`, `vwp/keyframe`, `vwp/delta`, `vwp/telemetry`, `vwp/metric`, `vwp/provenance`, `vwp/event/<channel-name>` |
| Schema | `name = "vwp.v1.<Type>"`, `encoding = "vwp1"`, `data` = the UTF-8 bytes of the relevant section of this document's layout tables (so the file is self-describing) |
| Message `data` | **the complete VWP frame, header included**, stored uncompressed |
| Message `log_time` / `publish_time` | `sim_time_ns` (so MCAP's index is a sim-time index) |
| Message `sequence` | the canonical `seq` |
| Chunk | zstd, target 4 MiB uncompressed; a chunk MUST NOT start in the middle of a GOP's keyframe |
| Metadata record `v2xw.manifest` | the run manifest of 02-architecture §6.5, as JSON |
| Attachment `scenario.yaml`, `world.vwb` | the exact scenario and world bytes |

**`DECISION`: the MCAP message payload is the whole frame including the 24-byte header.** The header is
32 bytes of redundancy per message against a trivially provable byte-identity guarantee and a replay path
that is a memcpy. Per-event payloads inside an `Event` frame are *not* split into one MCAP message each:
one `Event` frame is one MCAP message on `vwp/event/<channel>` when the batch is single-channel, and the
recorder splits mixed batches by channel so that per-channel message indexes work.

**Amendment, 2026-09-19 — this mapping describes the `vwp/…` namespace, and a second
namespace exists alongside it.** As written above, §7.1 places every channel, telemetry,
metric and event included, on a `vwp/…` topic carrying the complete frame. Build decision
D11 item 5 instead routes event, telemetry and metric records through serde to Parquet or
JSONL. Implementing both exposed that neither is the whole story, and that they serve
different consumers rather than competing.

A recording therefore carries **two topic namespaces**, and a single topic never carries
both encodings:

| Namespace | Payload | Encoding | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vwp/…` | the complete VWP frame, header included | `vwp1` | the replayable UI stream, where the byte-identity guarantee of §7.2 attaches |
| `record/…` | the serde-encoded `Record` for that channel | `json`, exported to Parquet or JSONL | datasets and analysis, where a self-describing columnar form is worth more than zero copy |

The table above and the `DECISION` note describe the `vwp/…` namespace only. §7.2's
byte-identity guarantee attaches to whatever was actually stored on a `vwp/…` topic; it
makes no claim about `record/…`, which is a lossy-by-design projection into a tabular
schema.

A reader of §7.1 alone would otherwise build a recorder that never writes a Parquet-bound
record, which is why this is stated here rather than only in the build decisions.

### 7.2 Byte-identity of live and replay

> **Guarantee.** For a given run, for every canonical frame, the 24-byte header with
> `flags &= CANONICAL_FLAG_MASK` and the entire body are byte-identical whether the frame was produced by
> the live engine or by the replay reader.

This follows from three properties, each of which is testable:

1. **Determinism of production.** Same scenario + seed + engine build + plug-in set ⇒ identical records
   (02-architecture §6.1). `seq`, `gop_index`, `step_index` and quantised poses are all derived from that
   record stream.
2. **Storage of the produced bytes.** The recorder stores the frame, not a re-encoding of the state.
3. **Flag separation.** Only `TRANSPORT_FLAG_MASK` bits (`COMPRESSED`, `RESYNC`, `CONTINUED`,
   `SEEK_RESULT`) may differ, and they are set by the *sender*, after the frame leaves the producer.
   The recorder MUST write frames with transport bits cleared.

Consequences the client can rely on:

- A client that hashes canonical bodies gets the same digest live and in replay.
- There is no replay-specific code path in the Studio (09-ui §7).
- `Hello` is *not* covered: it carries `resume_seq`, `sim_time_ns` and `hello_flags`, which are
  connection state. The recorded `Hello` is the one produced at run start.

Conformance test `golden_live_vs_replay`: run the Phase 1 scenario live with a recording client, replay the
resulting MCAP, and assert equality frame by frame after masking flags.

### 7.3 The seek algorithm

Given a target `t`:

```
1. footer        := read the last 8 + 20 bytes of the file          → summary_start, summary_offset_start
2. summary       := read [summary_start, footer)                    → channel/schema/statistics/chunk-index records
                    (cached after the first seek; ~1 record per chunk)
3. chunk_index   := the chunk-index records for channel vwp/keyframe
4. kf_chunk      := the last chunk whose message_index for vwp/keyframe has an entry with log_time <= t
5. read+decompress kf_chunk                                          (zstd, ≤ 4 MiB uncompressed)
6. kf            := the last keyframe in kf_chunk with sim_time_ns <= t
7. deltas        := all vwp/delta messages with kf.sim_time_ns < log_time <= t, in log_time order,
                    from kf_chunk and, if the GOP spans a chunk boundary, the next chunk
8. emit kf with FLAG_RESYNC | FLAG_SEEK_RESULT, then the deltas unchanged
9. resume normal production from t
```

Steps 1–3 are done once per file. Step 4 is a binary search over an in-memory array. Because a chunk never
starts in the middle of a keyframe (§7.1) and a GOP is at most `keyframe_period_ns` long, step 7 reads at
most two chunks.

**Optional companion state.** `Telemetry`, `Provenance` and the `sec.cert`/`proto.revocation` channels are
*sparse and stateful*: the value at time `t` is the last one at or before `t`. The reader answers them with
a "latest-at" query using the per-channel message index (the pattern Rerun's primary query cache uses,
cited in ADR 0008), and emits one synthetic `Telemetry` and one `Provenance` frame after the seek keyframe.
Those two frames are **not** part of the byte-identity guarantee and MUST carry `FLAG_SEEK_RESULT`.

### 7.4 The ≤ 100 ms seek budget

| Step | Budget (p95) | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| footer + summary (first seek only) | 5 ms | 2 reads, ≤ 256 KiB |
| chunk-index binary search | < 1 ms | in memory |
| read 1–2 chunks from disk | 15 ms | 2 × 1.5 MiB compressed at ≥ 200 MB/s |
| zstd decompress 1–2 chunks | 25 ms | 2 × 4 MiB at ≥ 400 MB/s |
| locate keyframe, collect ≤ 10 deltas | 3 ms | linear scan of a decompressed chunk |
| serialise + send | 5 ms | ≤ 400 KB, no re-encoding |
| client apply (keyframe + 10 deltas, 10 k actors) | 12 ms | typed-array writes, no parsing |
| **total** | **≤ 66 ms** | 34 ms of slack against the 100 ms target |

CI benchmark `bench_seek` (10-roadmap Phase 1 acceptance): on the `downtown-1km2` 600 s recording,
100 uniformly random seek targets, assert **p95 ≤ 100 ms** and **max ≤ 200 ms**, measured from the
`run.seek` request to the JSON-RPC reply, with the summary already cached. A second variant measures the
cold case (first seek) and asserts ≤ 150 ms.

### 7.5 WASM replay

The same Rust reader compiled to WASM serves the static-hosting mode (09-ui §9). It produces the identical
stream through an in-process channel instead of a socket; `Hello.world_ref.mode` is `1` and the world
arrives as `WorldChunk` frames (§3.9) because there is no engine HTTP server. Everything else is unchanged,
including `seq`, quantisation and the seek algorithm.

---

## 8. Versioning

### 8.1 Version numbers

`MAJOR.MINOR`. `MAJOR` is on the wire in every frame header and in the WebSocket subprotocol token
(`vwp.v1`); `MINOR` is in `Hello.version_minor` only.

- **MAJOR** changes when a reader built for the old version would mis-parse a new frame.
- **MINOR** changes when a reader built for the old version still parses every frame correctly but would
  miss information.

### 8.2 Negotiation

1. Client connects with `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: vwp.v1` and `?v=1`. A server that does not implement
   major 1 fails the upgrade with HTTP 426 and an `Upgrade` header listing what it does implement.
2. The server sends `Hello` with `version_major` and `version_minor`.
3. The client checks `version_major`. **`DECISION`: the client supports majors N and N−1 (per
   02-architecture §9), so a client built for major 2 accepts `Hello.version_major ∈ {1, 2}` and
   switches parser.** A client that cannot: close with 4406 after logging the mismatch.
4. The client ignores a `version_minor` higher than it knows and keeps parsing; it MUST NOT refuse.
5. A server that receives a request for a major it cannot serve sends `Error{-32050}` + `Bye` and closes
   with 4406, having first sent a `Hello` so the client can read `supported` from the error detail.

### 8.3 What is breaking (requires MAJOR)

- Changing the offset, size, type, unit, scale or meaning of any existing field.
- Removing a field, a section, a message type, a channel id or a JSON-RPC method.
- Reusing an enum value for a different meaning, or renumbering an enum.
- Changing a quantisation scale, an origin rule, or the delta reference rule (§3.2).
- Changing the frame-header size or the `CANONICAL_FLAG_MASK`.
- Changing which fields are GT (§5.2) in a way that *widens* what a `node`-profile stream contains.
- Making a previously optional JSON-RPC param required, or removing a result property.

### 8.4 What is additive (MINOR)

- A new message type id in the reserved range. Readers ignore unknown `msg_type` (§2.1).
- A new event channel id. Readers skip unknown channels by `payload_len` (§3.6.1).
- A new enum value in a range documented as extensible. Readers map unknown values to the enum's
  "other/unknown" member, which every enum in this document has at `0` or `0xFF`.
- New fields **appended into the reserved tail of a record that carries `record_size` on the wire**
  (`Telemetry`, `MetricSample`): the writer raises `record_size`, old readers stride by the new
  `record_size` and read only the prefix they know.
- New trailing **sections**, addressed by an `off_*` field carved out of a prefix's reserved bytes.
  Old readers never look at the reserved bytes, so they never see the section.
- New JSON-RPC methods, new optional params, new result properties, new error codes in
  −32000…−32099. Clients MUST tolerate unknown result properties.
- New string ids, new provenance entries, new overlays, new metrics.

### 8.5 The rule for adding a field

> To add a field in a minor version, it must land in bytes that a v1 reader is already required to ignore:
> a `reserved` field, the tail of a `record_size`-carrying record, or a new section behind a new `off_*`.
> If it cannot, it is a major change. There is no third option, and no field is ever "optional" on the
> wire.

Every prefix in §3 keeps reserved bytes for exactly this purpose: `Keyframe` has 10 (`reserved` +
`reserved64`), `Telemetry` records have 12, `MetricSample` and `Provenance` prefixes have 4, `Error` and
`Bye` have 7, and the world-file directory (§4.2) has 12.

`Hello`'s 256-byte prefix is fully assigned, on purpose. **`DECISION`: `Hello` grows by adding strings and
table rows, never prefix fields.** New per-node, per-class or per-channel information is a new column —
which is a major change — so in practice new `Hello` content in v1.x arrives as a new *string id* whose
meaning is fixed by this document (for example `str_manifest_url`, appended to the symbol table at a
documented index). This is not a limitation in practice: a client that needs structured run metadata calls
`run.status`, whose result is JSON and freely extensible.

### 8.6 Recording compatibility

An MCAP file records `version_major.version_minor` in the manifest metadata and in each schema record. The
replay reader refuses a file with a higher major (error `-32050`) and accepts a higher minor, ignoring what
it does not know. A file with a different plug-in hash set is refused with `-32012` unless
`--allow-plugin-drift` was given, which is then recorded in the manifest (02-architecture §8).

## 9. Worked example (unit-test vectors)

Every byte below was generated from the layout tables in §3 and then re-parsed by an independent decoder
written only from those tables: all four frames round-trip, every `off_*` lands where the tables predict,
every section size matches its formula, and the poses reconstruct to the metre values in the table below.
Use it as a golden test in both implementations. Offsets are **frame-relative** (the 24-byte header occupies
`0x00`–`0x17`, the body starts at `0x18`). The `seq` values (0, 10, 11, 12) are illustrative: `Hello`
carries the next canonical seq, and the keyframe and the two deltas here are the 11th, 12th and 13th
canonical frame of the run.

**Scenario of the example**

Actors in the keyframe at `t = 1.000 s`:

| 2 | 2 | 3.000 | 41.250 | 0.10 | none | π/2 (north) | 0.00 | 0.0 | pedestrian | `0x00` | 0 |

Signal `7` is in phase `3` (protected green) with 12.8 s to the next change.

Quantisation worked through, for slot 0:

```
x_mm = round((12.345 − (−500)) × 1000) = round(512345.0) = 512345  → 0x0007D179
y_mm = round((−3.210 − (−500)) × 1000) = round(496790.0) = 496790  → 0x00079496
z_cm = round((0.15 − 0) × 100)         = 15                        → 0x000F
heading_brad = round(0.0 × 65536 / 2π) = 0
speed_cq    = round(13.89 × 128)       = 1778   (13.890625 m/s on decode, error 0.6 mm/s)
accel_cq    = round(0.5 × 64)          = 32     (0.5 m/s² exactly)
```

and for slot 1: `heading_brad = round(π × 65536/2π) = 32768`, `speed_cq = 1408` (11.0 m/s exactly),
`accel_cq = round(−1.2 × 64) = −77` → `0xFFB3` (−1.203125 m/s² on decode).

### 9.4 `Delta` with a non-zero vertical delta — 128 bytes total (24 header + 104 body)

**This vector exists to pin one unit.** §3.2 defines the delta on all three axes as `i16`
millimetres against the previously transmitted quantised value, but the absolute vertical field is
centimetres everywhere it appears (§3.3.2, §3.4.3, §3.4.5), so "the same field" names a field in a
different unit from the delta. Every other worked example in §9 carries `dz_mm = 0`, so none of
them distinguishes the two readings, and a tenfold error survived in a real client because of it.
Prose cannot settle a unit; this vector can. A decoder that reads `dz_mm` as centimetres produces
`z = 1.150 m` for slot 0 below instead of `0.250 m` and fails on the first row.

It continues the worked example: it is the next canonical frame after §9.3, `seq = 12`, step 2 of
the same GOP, at `t = 1.2 s`. Slots 0 and 1 both entered the GOP at `z_cm = 15` (0.150 m) from the
§9.2 keyframe and were left there by §9.3, whose `dz_mm` is 0. Slot 0 rises by `dz_mm = +100` and
slot 1 falls by `dz_mm = −50`, so the vector pins the magnitude and the sign, and carries a
non-zero `dx_mm` alongside so the shared unit of the three axes is visible in one row.

Body size check: `64 (prefix) + 20 × 2 (moved) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 64 + 40 = 104`. ✔
`off_moved = 64`; every other `off_*` is `0`, which per §2.2 means the section is absent — and
`moved_count` is the only non-zero count, so nothing is declared that is not placed.

**Applying it to the state §9.3 left behind.** The vertical column is the point of the vector, so
it is shown before and after in both the transmitted quantisation and in metres:

| Slot | z before | `dz_mm` | z after | as `z_cm` | x before | `dx_mm` | x after |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.150 m (`z_cm = 15`) | `+100` | **0.250 m** | 25 | 13.734 m | `+1389` | 15.123 m |
| 1 | 0.150 m (`z_cm = 15`) | `−50` | **0.100 m** | 10 | −20.000 m | `−1100` | −21.100 m |

```
slot 0:  z = 15 cm × 10 = 150 mm;  150 + 100 = 250 mm  →  z = 0.250 m   (z_cm mirrors to 25)
         x_mm = 513734 + 1389 = 515123                 →  x = 515123/1000 + (−500) = 15.123 m
slot 1:  z = 15 cm × 10 = 150 mm;  150 − 50  = 100 mm  →  z = 0.100 m   (z_cm mirrors to 10)
         x_mm = 480000 − 1100 = 478900                 →  x = 478900/1000 + (−500) = −21.100 m
slot 2:  unchanged (not in the moved block)
```

The delta reference for the vertical axis is therefore the previously transmitted quantised value
**expressed in millimetres**, `z_cm × 10`, exactly as it is for `x` and `y`. A client that keeps its
vertical reference in centimetres and adds `dz_mm` into it is wrong by a factor of ten on every
vertical delta, and no other vector in this section would catch it.

only, `B` = both. The test-kit ids match `tests/conformance/vwp/` (03-interfaces §17).

### 10.1 Framing

- [ ] **B · F1** Rejects a frame whose `magic ≠ 0x31505756` (close 1002).
- [ ] **C · F2** Ignores a frame with an unknown `msg_type` and keeps the connection.
- [ ] **B · F3** `body_len` always equals the uncompressed body length, compressed or not.
- [ ] **B · F4** All integers and floats are little-endian; a big-endian host produces identical bytes.
- [ ] **B · F5** Every array offset satisfies §2.2 alignment; a client can build typed-array views in place
      with no copy for an uncompressed frame.
- [ ] **B · F6** Reserved header and prefix bytes are written as zero and ignored on read.
- [ ] **S · F7** `Hello` is never compressed, even when longer than 4 KiB.
- [ ] **B · F8** zstd round-trips every frame type; `compress=none` is honoured.
- [ ] **C · F9** Unknown flag bits are ignored, not treated as errors.

### 10.2 Handshake, resume, backpressure

- [ ] **S · H1** `Hello` is the first frame and arrives within 1000 ms of the upgrade.
- [ ] **S · H2** The first canonical frame after a non-resumed `Hello` is a `Keyframe` with `FLAG_RESYNC`.
- [ ] **C · H3** Sends nothing before receiving `Hello`.
- [ ] **B · H4** `seq` is dense and monotonic across canonical frames; `Hello`/`Error`/`Bye` do not consume
      a `seq` and carry the next one.
- [ ] **S · H5** `?session=<token>&resume=<seq>` inside the ring resumes with `HELLO_RESUMED`, replays the
      missed frames and has no gap, no duplicate and no resync keyframe; a second socket with the token
      supersedes the first (`Bye{reason = 4}`, close 1012).
- [ ] **S · H6** `?resume=<seq>` outside the ring falls back to `Hello` + `FLAG_RESYNC` keyframe, never an
      error.
- [ ] **S · H7** Under a client that reads at 1/10 the production rate, memory is bounded: queued bytes
      never exceed `max_queued_bytes`, and the sim loop never blocks. Test `bp_slow_client`.
- [ ] **S · H8** After a drop, a `Keyframe` with `FLAG_RESYNC` arrives within `resync_deadline_ms` of wall
      time, and a `stream.drop` notification names the gap.
- [ ] **S · H9** Deltas are dropped all-or-nothing; a client never receives a delta whose predecessor in
      the same GOP was dropped.
- [ ] **C · H10** Detects a `seq` gap without the notification and refuses to apply deltas until the next
      keyframe.
- [ ] **S · H11** Ping every 15 s; closes with 1001 after 30 s without a Pong.

### 10.3 Poses and state

- [ ] **B · Q1** Quantisation matches §3.2 exactly, including half-away-from-zero rounding and the brad
      wrap formula, for the vectors in §9.
- [ ] **S · Q2** Delta references are computed against the previously *transmitted quantised* value, so
      keyframe + all deltas reproduces the server's state bit for bit at every step of a GOP.
      Test `no_quantisation_drift`: 10,000 steps, assert max deviation ≤ 1 mm.
- [ ] **S · Q3** A displacement over 32,000 mm in one step sets `MFLAG_ABSOLUTE` and appears in the
      absolute block. Test `teleport_escape`.
- [ ] **B · Q4** Keyframe actor rows are indexed by slot, with `actor_id = 0xFFFFFFFF` for empty slots.
- [ ] **S · Q5** A slot is not reused until one full keyframe period after its despawn.
- [ ] **B · Q6** `state` bit semantics match §3.3.4; "benign" is the absence of bits 0–2.
- [ ] **C · Q7** Renders correctly when `lane_id` is `0xFFFFFFFF` and when `accel_cq` is 0 (node profile).

### 10.4 Content

- [ ] **B · C1** Every field of §3.5.2 is populated or explicitly set to its unknown sentinel; no field is
      silently zero.
- [ ] **B · C2** `Telemetry.record_size` is honoured for striding, not assumed to be 208.
- [ ] **B · C3** Unknown event `channel_id`s are skipped by `payload_len` without desynchronising.
- [ ] **B · C4** Event index arrays are sorted by `(sim_time_ns, channel_id)` and payloads are 8-aligned.
- [ ] **S · C5** Every `prov_id` referenced by a `MetricSample` or an event payload has been delivered in
      a `Provenance` frame before it is first referenced.
- [ ] **C · C6** `explain` on any displayed value resolves without an "unknown provenance" fallback.
- [ ] **B · C7** The symbol table is append-only within a connection and resets on a non-resumed `Hello`.

### 10.5 World

- [ ] **S · W1** `GET /world/{hash}.vwb` returns a body whose SHA-256 equals `{hash}` and
      `Hello.world_hash`.
- [ ] **S · W2** COOP/COEP/CORP headers are present on every HTTP response and on the upgrade.
- [ ] **C · W3** Verifies the world hash and refuses a mismatch.
- [ ] **B · W4** The JSON and binary forms of a world carry the same lanes, buildings, junctions, signals,
      sites and bbox. Test `world_json_binary_parity`.
- [ ] **S · W5** `world.generate` with the same params and seed produces the same `world_hash` on every
      platform.
- [ ] **C · W6** Handles `world_ref.mode = 1` (WorldChunk) and `mode = 2` (already have it).

### 10.6 Visibility

- [ ] **S · V1** In `profile=node`, none of the fields or channels of §5.2 appear, checked field by field
      by the `node_profile_leakage` test, which decodes the whole stream and asserts every GT field is at
      its sentinel and every GT channel is absent.
- [ ] **S · V2** In `profile=node`, actors without `ST_EQUIPPED` occupy empty slots.
- [ ] **S · V3** `events.set` on a GT channel, `metrics.query` on a GT metric, and `overlay.set` on a
      `*_gt` overlay all return `-32040`.
- [ ] **S · V4** The profile cannot be changed by any control method.
- [ ] **S · V5** A `full` recording replayed with `profile=node` yields byte-identical frames to a live
      `node` run of the same scenario. Test `node_profile_replay_parity`.
- [ ] **S · V6** Every exporter's output passes the leakage linter, and GT and NODE never share a file
      unless the exporter is declared `mixed` and the file is tagged.

### 10.7 Control surface

- [ ] **S · R1** All 33 methods of §6.15 are implemented and appear in `rpc.discover`.
- [ ] **S · R2** `rpc.discover` is a valid OpenRPC 1.3.2 document, and every params/result schema in it
      validates the corresponding example.
- [ ] **S · R3** Invalid params return `-32602` with a `data` array of `{path, message, hint}`.
- [ ] **S · R4** `run.seek` sends the keyframe and all deltas *before* the reply.
- [ ] **S · R5** `run.pause` has sent every frame up to and including the reply's `t_ns`.
- [ ] **S · R6** `run.step {unit:"event"}` advances exactly one DES event in `(time, priority, seq)` order.
- [ ] **S · R7** `POST /rpc` accepts the same requests; connection-scoped methods return `-32009`.
- [ ] **S · R8** Operations that exceed 2 s return a `Job` and emit `job.progress` / `job.done`.
- [ ] **C · R9** Tolerates unknown result properties and unknown notification methods.
- [ ] **S · R10** JSON-RPC batch arrays are rejected with `-32600`.

### 10.8 Replay

- [ ] **B · P1** `golden_live_vs_replay`: every canonical frame is byte-identical after masking
      `TRANSPORT_FLAG_MASK`.
- [ ] **S · P2** `bench_seek`: p95 ≤ 100 ms, max ≤ 200 ms over 100 random seeks on `downtown-1km2`;
      cold first seek ≤ 150 ms.
- [ ] **S · P3** The recorder stores whole frames with transport flag bits cleared.
- [ ] **S · P4** Seeking to `t` produces a keyframe with `sim_time_ns ≤ t` and at most
      `keyframe_period_ns / mobility_step_ns` deltas.
- [ ] **S · P5** The WASM reader emits the same stream as the native reader for the same file.
- [ ] **S · P6** A recording with a higher major is refused (`-32050`); a higher minor is accepted.

### 10.9 Versioning

- [ ] **B · N1** A v1 reader parses a synthetic v1.1 stream that adds a message type, a channel id, a
      telemetry field (larger `record_size`) and a new JSON-RPC method, losing only the new information.
- [ ] **S · N2** The subprotocol token is `vwp.v1` and an unknown one fails the upgrade with 426.
- [ ] **C · N3** Accepts `version_major ∈ {N, N−1}` and refuses anything else with close 4406.

## Appendix B — Message-type summary

| Id | Name | Dir | Cadence | Body size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0001` | `Hello` | S→C | once per connection | 256 + 32N + 24C + 8K + 16 + strings |
| `0x0002` | `Keyframe` | S→C | `keyframe_period_ns` (1 s), + resync/seek | 64 + 28A + 8S |
| `0x0003` | `Delta` | S→C | `mobility_step_ns` (100 ms) | 64 + 20M + 12·abs + 4·lanes + 36P + 8D + 8S |

| `0x00FE` | `Error` | S→C | on stream error | 32 + strings |
| `0x00FF` | `Bye` | S→C | once, last | 32 + strings |

Bandwidth at the design point (10,000 actors, 1 s keyframes, 100 ms deltas, no event subscriptions):
280 KB/s of keyframes + 9 × ~150 KB/s of deltas ≈ 1.6 MB/s raw, ≈ 400–550 KB/s after zstd.

## Appendix C — Decision log

Every place this document made a choice the design documents left open, or corrected.

| # | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Subprotocol token `vwp.v1` carries the major version | a mismatched client fails at the handshake, not at the first frame |
| 2 | Binary = telemetry, text = JSON-RPC, no in-band discriminator | the WebSocket framing layer already separates them, for free |
| 3 | Client sends nothing first; server sends `Hello` within 1 s | one less round trip before pixels |
| 4 | 24-byte header with `seq` in it | resume needs a sequence number on every frame, and 24 is 8-aligned |
| 5 | Magic `0x31505756` = wire bytes `VWP1` | greppable in a hex dump |
| 6 | **Flat fixed-layout struct-of-arrays, not FlatBuffers** (amends ADR 0008) | zero *parsing*, not just zero copy; one table beats three code generators; the recorder stores the same bytes |
| 7 | Resume ring = `max(2 GOPs, 8 MiB)`, ≤ 4096 frames | two GOPs guarantee a retained keyframe before any resume point |
| 8 | Backpressure: drop all deltas → drop P3 oldest-first → coalesce keyframes → `FLAG_RESYNC` keyframe within 250 ms | bounded memory, and a keyframe is idempotent so synthesising one is always legal |
| 9 | Drops reported by JSON-RPC notification, not in a binary field | keeps binary frames byte-identical live vs replay |
| 10 | zstd only, level 3, only for bodies ≥ 4 KiB | same codec as the MCAP chunks; level 3 encodes a 300 KB keyframe in under 1 ms |
| 11 | **Keyframe positions are `i32` mm, not `i16` mm** (corrects ADR 0008) | `i16` mm spans ±32.767 m and cannot address a 1 km² world from one origin; `i16` mm is right for *deltas*, and is kept there |
| 12 | Keyframe origin = `floor(bbox_min)`, constant for the run | `i32` mm reaches ±2,147 km, so re-centring is never needed; the field stays per-keyframe for future minor versions |
| 13 | Delta positions are relative to the previous frame of the GOP, computed against the **quantised** reference | no accumulated drift; GOP ordering is already guaranteed |
| 14 | `MFLAG_ABSOLUTE` escape for displacements > 32 m | removes the only failure mode of `i16` deltas |
| 15 | Heading = `u16` binary radians (65536/turn) | wraps by construction, 2 bytes, 0.0055° |
| 16 | Speed `i16` at 1/128 m/s, acceleration `i16` at 1/64 m/s² | power-of-two scales are exact; ±256 m/s and ±512 m/s² cover everything |
| 17 | World geometry in `f32` ENU metres | ulp is 0.12 mm at 1 km and 1.2 mm at 10 km *because* coordinates are world-local; the "f32 gives 0.1 m" worry applies to projected absolutes, which never appear on the wire |
| 18 | Keyframe actor rows are a dense array indexed by slot | matches the UI's `SharedArrayBuffer` pose rings keyed by slot (09-ui §2) |
| 19 | World fetched by HTTP GET on a content hash; `WorldChunk` only for static/WASM hosting | immutable, cacheable, shared between runs, and it does not sit behind the telemetry stream |
| 20 | World v1 keeps outer building rings only; holes dropped at import and recorded in provenance | neither the obstacle model nor the extruded-footprint renderer uses them |
| 21 | Lane connectivity and conflict matrices are not in the world payload | the UI never needs them; they would roughly double the payload |
| 22 | `Telemetry` and `MetricSample` are arrays of structs with a wire `record_size`; poses are struct-of-arrays | consumers read telemetry one node at a time; `record_size` is the cheapest additive-evolution path |
| 23 | `NODE-only` keeps the pose of *equipped* actors and drops unequipped ones entirely | an unequipped actor transmits nothing, so nothing node-visible can know it; equipped actors' positions are what their own broadcasts assert |
| 24 | `NODE-only` withholds `proto.revocation` stages 0–4 | stages before `issued` are internal to the MA and would leak the answer |
| 25 | Profile is fixed at connect and immutable | a profile that can be toggled is not a blind evaluation |
| 26 | `rpc.discover` returns OpenRPC 1.3.2 | the standard self-description for JSON-RPC; the copilot registry, the CLI and the Python stubs generate from it |
| 27 | No JSON-RPC batching | ordering against the binary stream gets murky and no caller needs it |
| 28 | No event channel is subscribed by default | `phy.rx` alone is millions of records per simulated second |
| 29 | Any operation over 2 s returns a `Job` + notifications | the socket is for the stream, not for waiting |
| 30 | MCAP message payload = the whole frame, header included | makes byte-identity a memcpy rather than an argument |
| 31 | Seek emits synthetic `Telemetry` + `Provenance` with `FLAG_SEEK_RESULT`, outside the byte-identity guarantee | these channels are latest-at, so a seek must reconstruct them |
| 32 | Client supports majors N and N−1; unknown minors are parsed and the extra ignored | matches 02-architecture §9 and makes minor bumps free |
| 33 | Fields may only be added into reserved bytes, a `record_size` tail, or a new `off_*` section | one rule, mechanically checkable, no "optional" wire fields |
| 34 | **`content_hash` is the SHA-256 of the body with its own 32 bytes zeroed** (§4.2 amendment, 2026-09-18) | a digest stored inside the data it covers has to exclude itself somehow; zeroing the field is what both independent implementations already did, and it needs no second pass over the body |

## Appendix D — Things this document invented

The design documents did not specify these; they are new here and should be reflected back into the ADRs
if accepted.

1. **The whole binary layout.** ADR 0008 named the message types; every byte offset, type, unit, enum and
   sentinel in §2–§4 is new, as is the decision (#6) to drop FlatBuffers for v1.
2. **The slot model.** 09-ui §2 mentions "actor slot" in passing; slot assignment (lowest free),
   release-after-one-keyframe, dense-array indexing and the delta reference semantics are new.
3. **`seq`, the resume ring and the reconnect state machine.** Nothing in the design covers reconnect.
4. **The backpressure policy** (priority classes, drop order, coalescing, synthesised keyframes,
   `stream.drop`, `stall_timeout_s`). The design only says the seek must be fast.
5. **The symbol table.** An interning scheme for detector ids, metric names, app ids and flow ids, with
   append-only `Provenance` extensions.
6. **The `vwp-world/1` format** (§4), including the JSON mirror and the hole-dropping rule.
7. **Event payload layouts** (§3.6.4–§3.6.17). 03-interfaces §14 lists key *field names* per channel; the
   types, units, enums, sizes and `msg_id` join key are new.
8. **The `NodeTelemetry` binary record** (§3.5.2). 06-node-models §2.4 lists the quantities in prose; every
   type, unit, scale (per-mille, centi-dBm, KiB) and sentinel is new.
9. **The exact GT field list and the `node`-profile blanking rules** (§5.2). The design says GT channels
   are tagged and stripped; which *columns* of the mixed snapshot channel are GT was open.
10. **The JSON-RPC schemas** (§6). 09-ui §8 and 02-architecture §9 list method *names*; every params
    schema, result schema and error code is new, as are `run.resume`, `run.status`, `events.set` filters,
    `Job` semantics and the eight server→client notifications.
11. **Error-code numbering** in the −32000…−32099 application range.
12. **The seek budget breakdown** (§7.4) and the `bench_seek` pass criteria. The design states the 100 ms
    target and says CI must guard it; the per-step budget is new.
13. **The versioning rules** (§8), in particular the "reserved bytes, `record_size` tail, or new `off_*`"
    rule and the breaking/additive classification.
14. **The conformance checklist** (§10) and the test ids.
15. **Two corrections to the design**: the `i16`-mm keyframe quantisation (decision #11) and the FlatBuffers
    choice (decision #6). Both should be recorded as amendments to ADR 0008.
